We have updated our tournament guide and have finally encompassed it into one visually more attractive document. Please find the new tournament guide here:

[Star Wars Tournament Guide 2.1](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Star-Wars-CCG-Official-Tournament-Guide-2.1-Feb-2017.pdf)

The tournament committee will now also review and revise this document 1-2 times a year, so that any changes (after meeting the approval of all instances of the committee) will make it into the next update. It is our intention to do this well ahead of the major tournaments (especially the world championship and MPC), but with many volunteers and volunteer groups involved in the decisions, some last minute decisions might still be unavoidable.

Thanks to Chris Schoenthal and the tournament committee for making the update, and a personal thank you to Chris Kelly and Team Wales without who I couldnâ€™t have finished the visual upgrade.

May the tournament guide be with You!
