LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. <a href="http://www.authentictitansshop.com/Jurrell-Casey-Titans-Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jurrell Casey Womens Jersey</strong></a> . &#8212; The Chicago Cubs obtained the right-handed outfield bat they needed, acquiring Justin Ruggiano from the Miami Marlins for lefty swinging Brian Bogusevic. The deal was announced at baseballs winter meetings Thursday. Ruggiano, who turns 32 in April, has played parts of five big league seasons with Tampa Bay (2007-08, 2011) and Miami (2012-13). He hit a career-high 18 homers in 472 at-bats for Miami last year. Hes a .251 hitter for his career. In 317 games, he has 37 homers and 109 RBIs. The Cubs had left-handers Nate Schierholtz and Ryan Sweeney in the outfield, making Bogusevic available for trades. Bogusevic, who turns 30 in February, hit .273 with six homers and 16 RBI in 47 games last year. In 299 games over four years &#8212; the first three in Houston &#8212; Bogusevic has 17 homers and 62 RBIs with a .273 average. He could help fill the hole created by lefty Logan Morrison, who was dealt to Seattle on Wednesday for reliever relief pitcher Carter Capps. <a href="http://www.authentictitansshop.com/Nate-Washington-Titans-Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nate Washington Womens Jersey</strong></a> . &#8212; Age really is just a number for Eduardo Sebrango. <a href="http://www.authentictitansshop.com/Michael-Oher-Titans-Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Michael Oher Jersey</strong></a> . &#8212; Boston police have been investigating whether jailed former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez may have been the gunman in a 2012 double slaying, according to a search warrant request released Thursday. NICE, France &#8212; Second-seeded Ernests Gulbis will meet Federico Delbonis in the Open de Nice final after brushing aside defending champion Albert Montanes on Friday. Gulbis of Latvia dropped just one point on his first serve on his way to a 6-0, 6-3 victory over the Spaniard. &#8220;He allowed me to play,&#8221; Gulbis said. &#8220;I felt confident from the first rally on. I had good timing. The first set was one of the best sets I have played.&#8221; The seventh-seeded Delbonis ousted fourth-seeded Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-4. Gulbis has won all five of his previous finals on the ATTP tour, and triumphed in Marseille in February. <a href="http://www.authentictitansshop.com/Al-Woods-Titans-Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Al Woods Womens Jersey</strong></a>. Delbonis, who beat top-seeded John Isner in the quarterfinals, is 1-1 in his previous tour finals. The 23-year-old Argentine lifted his first title in Sao Paolo in March, after losing in Hamburg last year. &#8220;It was a pretty good match,&#8221; Delbonis said. &#8220;Gilles always fights and he showed it in the second set when he broke me. But I took control again. &#8220;The final will be very similar to the match against Isner. Ernests has a strong service. If I am focused, I will always have a chance.&#8221; &#8216; &#8216; &#8216;
