Hi, my name is Peyton and I am new to the star wars card game.  I recently got some new cards that are.

1. There is good in him/I can save him (objective)

2. Luke&#8217;s Lightsaber

3. Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout

4. I feel the conflict

5. Endor landing platform

6. Endor: chief chirpa&#8217;s hut

What I don&#8217;t have is a starting interrupt to go with these cards so I would like to know what you think the best  starting interrupt would be.

Thank you for your time

Sincerely Yours, Peyton
