Hello,  
I am a new swccg player. I was wondering which defensive shields I should play or use for my MWYHL/SYUC deck. Another thing I was wondering about is what should I being doing while I am attempting the Jedi Tests. What I mean by that is, should I be building and drawing other Jedi&#8217;s to support my Skywalker or what should I be doing?

Thanks,  
Loberg-Irish
