So I am getting back into the game after a long time off. I saw a WHAP deck list that looked cool but had a question? The post and strategy explanation said that they pull Yoda, Master of the Force either first turn or very early and arm him with the v Jedi Lightsaber. Can Yoda use the weapon even though he does not have a Warrior Icon? Thanks for your help!
