My husband and I have started going through the cubic foot or so of star wars ccg cards we have to determine what we would like to do with them.  Right now i think our plan is to build 4-6 decks for casual play, then either tossing or selling the remainder. Does anyone have any suggestions for decks?  Neither of us are interested in tournament play, and all the cards we have on hand are from pre-virtual sets.   Right now, what we have just takes up too much space and is too daunting to pull out to play with.

I assume most of the commons and uncommons are pretty worthless, but is there anything in particular I should keep an eye out for prior to just tossing what we don&#8217;t want?  I imagine we have some complete or nearly complete series.
