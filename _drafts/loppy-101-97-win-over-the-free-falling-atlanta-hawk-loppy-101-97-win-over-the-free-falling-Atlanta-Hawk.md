WASHINGTON &#8212; The Washington Wizards are inching closer to their first playoff spot since 2008 and can earn a post-season berth Sunday if the Golden State Warriors beat the New York Knicks. <a href="http://www.patriotsstore.us.com/Black-62-Ryan-Wendell-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ryan Wendell Patriots Jersey</strong></a> . After the Wizards sloppy 101-97 win over the free-falling Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night, they insisted theyre not looking ahead &#8212; at least not publicly. &#8220;If the Knicks lose, Ill be more excited. Id know Id be playing in the playoffs,&#8221; John Wall said. Wall scored 25 points and Drew Gooden added 16 for Washington, which is sixth in the Eastern Conference. Wall scored 13 points in the last 7:16 of the third quarter and the Wizards finally escaped the pesky Hawks, who have lost six straight and 20 of 26. Jeff Teague scored 19 points and Paul Millsap 17 for Atlanta. Washington had to overcome a slow start coming off its impressive 13-point win over Eastern Conference leader Indiana on Friday to beat the Hawks, who lead the Knicks by 1 1/2 games for the final playoff berth in the East. They also had to deal with the effects of a Saturday afternoon hockey game at the Verizon Center. Because of the Washington Capitals game with the Boston Bruins, the starting time of the Wizards game was pushed back an hour. The changeover left the floor slippery and may have caused a groin injury to Washington forward Trevor Ariza. &#8220;Good thing nobody got seriously injured, but we got to work on that. Somebody couldve really got hurt. We got to keep ourselves safe,&#8221; Ariza said. &#8220;I tried to play the game as fast as I can all the time, but after I fell and slipped, I slowed down for sure.&#8221; He finished with 13 points. Bradley Beal had 14. &#8220;That floor was awful tonight. I apologize for that,&#8221; coach Randy Wittman said. Washington led 99-89 with 2:38 to play, but the Hawks scored eight straight including three free throws by Lou Williams and a three-point play by Teague with 39.8 to play. Teagues three points came immediately after Wall missed two foul shots. With the Wizards leading 99-97, Marcin Gortat blocked Teagues shot with 11.1 seconds left. Gooden was fouled by Teague and hit two free throws to secure the win. &#8220;We call this fatigue. We call this fatigue and too relaxed. Im glad we won that game. Otherwise, Id probably shoot myself at home,&#8221; Gortat said. He had 12 points and 11 rebounds. Wittman wasnt pleased with how his team closed out the game. &#8220;Disappointed in that, but theres not a bad win in this league. Well take the win,&#8221; Wittman said. Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer, whose team played well despite missing three of its five leading scorers, had been hoping for a comeback. &#8220;Its amazing how long an NBA game is and what can happen in the last two minutes,&#8221; Budenholzer said. The game was interrupted countless times by the condensation, which seemed to bother Wizards players more than Hawks. It was reminiscent of a Jan. 11 game that featured two lengthy stoppages when a heavy rainstorm hit the area and delayed Washingtons game with Houston. The Hawks started hot, hitting seven of their first eight shots and running out to a 21-11 advantage, but Washington got eight late points from Gooden, outscoring the Hawks 16-7 in the last 4:31 to lead 28-27 after one. Thanks to nine points in the last five minutes by Pero Antic, Atlanta led 52-50 at halftime. Walls third-quarter offensive display gave the Wizards a 75-71 lead after going into the fourth. NOTES: Washington F/C Nene, who has missed 17 games with a left knee sprain is progressing, though Wittman isnt guessing when he may return. &#8220;Hes going on the floor a little bit, on his own, just kind of getting on his legs a little bit,&#8221; Wittman said. &#8220;Where that takes us I dont know. Hes going in a good direction.&#8221; &#8230; Atlanta was without G/F Kyle Korver (back spasms) and G DeMarre Carroll (stomach virus). &#8230; Wizards G Andre Miller was called for a flagrant foul on Hawks G Dennis Schroder in the fourth quarter, but Schroder missed both foul shots. <a href="http://www.patriotsstore.us.com/Black-12-Tom-Brady-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tom Brady Patriots Jersey</strong></a> . Ecclestone said at the beginning of a four-hour personal statement read out in German by his lawyers that he was &#8220;grateful&#8221; to be able to give his side of the story &#8212; though he told judges that he would answer questions from the Munich state court through his lawyers, rather than personally. <a href="http://www.patriotsstore.us.com/Black-63-Dan-Connolly-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Patriots #63 Jersey</strong></a> .7 seconds to play, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Dallas Mavericks 94-92 in a preseason game Monday night. Anthony Davis paced New Orleans (2-0) with 25 points and seven rebounds. MINSK, Belarus &#8212; Finland blanked the Czech Republic 3-0 in the semifinals of the ice hockey world championship on Saturday to set up a final against Russia. Earlier Saturday, Russia beat defending champion Sweden 3-1 in a matchup of the last two title holders to advance to the title game. Finlands Jori Lehtera netted a backhand in the first period before Jarkko Immonen scored on a power play in the second and Lehtera added his second into the empty net in the third. Goaltender Pekka Rinne stopped 20 shots for the shutout. Finland struggled in the group stage, losing three games, and needed a help from Switzerland to advance before eliminated Canada in the quarter-finals. &#8220;We had a tough time in the group stage and almost every game was a must win for. Now, weve been able to enjoy the game, nothing to lose&#8221; Rinne said. &#8220;As a team weve come together and its been great fun. Im really excited about this opportunity.&#8221; Russia meanwhile, has won all nine of its games at the tournament, and is now one win away from its second title in three years and has a chance to avenge a disappointing loss to Finland in the quarter-finals in the Sochi Olympics. Finland last won the worlds in 2011. &#8220;Our team has a character,&#8221; Russia coach Oleg Znarok said. Showing off its attacking power, Russia rebounded from an opening goal by Oscar Moller just 19 seconds into the game as Sergei Plotnikov and Sergei Shirokov both scored later in the first period. Defenceman Anton Belov drove a slap shot into the net on a rebound to make it 3-1 in the ssecond in front of roaring Russian fans. <a href="http://www.patriotsstore.us.com/Black-66-Bryan-Stork-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Patriots #66 Jersey</strong></a>. Russia outshot Sweden 34-23, while goaltender Sergei Bobrovski made big saves to deny Moller and Joakim Lindstrom in the middle period. Danis Zaripov and defenceman Evgeni Medvedev had two assists each and star forward Alex Ovechkin got one assist in his second straight game after recovering from a right leg injury. &#8220;I had a new knee brace and felt much better,&#8221; Ovechkin said. &#8220;I cant say I am 100 per cent fit but the situation is that one must be ready for anything. We have one game left and we must do everything to make sure we win.&#8221; Plotnikov scored from the right circle on a rebound after 13:25 and Shirokov wristed a shot past goaltender Anders Nilsson to put Russia 2-1 ahead with two minutes left in the period. &#8220;I dont think we came up to our best level,&#8221; Nilsson said. &#8220;I think they were better than us today, they had more chances and we didnt create enough chances to win.&#8221; Sweden pulled Nilsson with more than two minutes to play in the third and their advantage increased to six-on-four when Denis Denisov was penalized for interference with 1:40 remaining. But all Swedish hopes ended when Mikael Backlund was ejected for a hit on Plotnikov. That incident prompted angry exchanges between Znarok and a Swedish team official. Sweden and the Czechs now have to recover for Sundays bronze medal game. &#8220;Its not the medal we wanted to play for the last game but we dont want to go home empty handed,&#8221; Sweden forward Gustav Nyquist said. &#8216; &#8216; &#8216;
