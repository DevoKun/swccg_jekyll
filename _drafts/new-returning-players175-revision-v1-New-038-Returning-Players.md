# New Players Area 

## Introduction 

Welcome (back?) to Star Wars CCG! Ever since 1995 players have enjoyed playing out the infinite scenarios in the Star Wars universe through this card game, which is very much still alive and thriving. Whether you are brand new to the game or dusting off your collection to dive back in to the fun you remember having, this page is a great place to start familiarizing yourself to the Star Wars CCG universe.Although the game is no longer produced by Decipher, Inc., new cards and concepts are still being developed by the Star Wars CCG Players Committee and new expansions are still being released to keep the game fresh and exciting. And the best news is – it’s all for free now! You can learn more about the history of the game here if you’re interested – otherwise, welcome to your favorite galaxy that’s far, far away…

## The Game 

As its name implies, the Star Wars Customizable Card Game is a trading card game, like Magic: The Gathering, set in the Star Wars universe. It is a two player game where one player is the Light Side of the Force, and the other is the Dark Side. Each player builds a deck of 60 cards (consisting of the characters, starships, locations, weapons and events drawn from the Star Wars universe) and tries to damage the opponent by causing them to lose cards from their deck. Once a player has no cards in their deck, they lose.The basic rules (which would be best for you to review and start with), can be found here, or to view a sample game being played, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crngwell/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars CCG YouTube channel</a>  for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyXWzJ584hE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videos like this</a>  (keeping in mind your games in real life will generally be quicker and much most fast paced than these played on the computer, especially as you get more advanced).

## Getting Started 

It is recommend you start by registering (for free) with the Star Wars CCG message boards. From there you can always ask any questions you have and received a response.

You’re also going to want to see what the various cards do. This includes the <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/PremiereType.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Decipher cards</strong></a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/virtual-slips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Virtual Cards</strong></a> (which are free cards produced in a pdf by the Player’s Committee – to use them, you simply print out the pdf file, cut out the card(s) you want, and lay them over top of the specified card for a brand new card!). Obviously going through each of the thousands of cards would not be a good use of your time, but those links can be a good reference to see what a card does in case you come across it being mentioned in any discussions. However, one quick way to jump start your experience is to <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/virtual-slips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>download the New Player Demo Decks</strong></a> (for free! Located under the &#8220;Misc&#8221; tab in the Virtual Cards page). These decks will give you instant access to fun, playable pre-constructed decks, regardless of your personal card collection. Obtaining cards

Since Decipher no longer prints the cards, the cards are finite. However, they are still very, very available online and in the card playing community. While many playing groups will gladly let you borrow cards and help you learn the game, should there come a time when you do wish to build a collection, there are many online stores, including the **Player’s Committee’s store**, that can help.

The good news is that cards for the Star Wars CCG are generally much, much cheaper than cards for the other popular card games – in fact, since the virtual set expansions are free, once you get your collection, you won’t have to spend any more money buying expensive booster boxes for each new set every time a new expansion comes out like you would for other games.

Finding players

If you don’t have a local card shop to talk cards in or find other players, the [**Player Locator**](https://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=348) can put you in touch with nearby players. Additionally, the [**message boards**](https://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/index.php) can be very useful in getting you started into the community.

Online Play

The game can also be played (for free) online using either of two different programs: **Holotable** or **GEMP**. More information about online play can be **found [here](https://www.starwarsccg.org/online-play/)**.
