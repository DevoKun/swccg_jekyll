NEW YORK &#8212; Infielder Matt Tuiasosopo, whose father and brother played in the NFL, has agreed to a minor league contract with the New York Mets. <a href="http://www.shopjerseysbengals.com/Womens-Andre-Smith-Authentic-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Andre Smith</strong></a>. The 25-year-old hit .226 with 14 homers and 77 RBIs in 439 at-bats last season with Seattles triple-A Tacoma farm team. He has a .176 average with five homers and 15 RBIs with the Mariners from 2008-10. His father, Manu, was with the Seattle Seahawks for three seasons. His brother, Marques, was with the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets for eight seasons. The Mets announced the deal on Friday. <a href="http://www.shopjerseysbengals.com/Womens-Jermaine-Gresham-Authentic-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jermaine Gresham</strong></a> . The Astros were swept by the As in a three-game series in Oakland last week and there still seemed to be some animosity between the teams from an 11-3 loss in the first game of that series. <a href="http://www.shopjerseysbengals.com/Womens-Domata-Peko-Authentic-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Domata Peko</strong></a> . &#8211; Dwight Howard returned for the first time to Staples Center, where the Los Angeles Clippers ran his Houston Rockets off the floor with their most points in four years.NEW YORK &#8212; Cam Talbot, subbing for resting Olympian Henrik Lundqvist, stopped 31 shots, and Derick Brassard and Rick Nash scored as the New York Rangers returned from the Sochi break with a 2-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Thursday night. Talbot got the nod after Lundqvist received extended work in Swedens run to the gold medal game in the Olympics. Talbot made the most of his opportunity,, getting his 11th career win in 18 NHL games &#8212; all this season. <a href="http://www.shopjerseysbengals.com/Womens-Mike-Nugent-Authentic-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mike Nugent</strong></a>. He was 11.6 seconds away from a shutout, but Peter Regin scored after goalie Corey Crawford was pulled. Patrick Kane nearly tied it seconds later, but Talbot stopped him with his pad. New York has won six of seven. Lundqvist is expected to play Saturday in Philadelphia when the Rangers start a back-to-back set. &#8216; &#8216; &#8216;
