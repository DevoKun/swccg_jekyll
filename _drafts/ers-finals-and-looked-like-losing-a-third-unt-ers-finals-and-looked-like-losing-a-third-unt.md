MONACO &#8212; Stanislas Wawrinka won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time Sunday, rallying to beat Roger Federer 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2 in a rare all-Swiss final. <a href="http://www.dolphinsstore.us.com/Black-1-Damian-Williams-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Damian Williams Dolphins Jersey</strong></a> . The Australian Open champion had lost his previous two Masters finals and looked like losing a third until Federers level dropped suddenly late in the second set, and Wawrinka began troubling the 17-time Grand Slam champion with his aggressive backhand. The fourth-seeded Federer, who accepted a wild card invitation to play in the tournament, was also looking to win it for the first time after losing his three previous finals here to eight-time champion Rafael Nadal from 2006-08. Wawrinka has beaten Federer only twice in 15 matches but both victories have come here. He also beat him in the third round in 2009. &#8220;Its exceptional to be able to win my first Masters title here,&#8221; Wawrinka said. It was the first time that Federer and Wawrinka met in a championship decider. In the last all-Swiss final, Marc Rosset beat Federer in Marseille in 2000. &#8220;Stan was tougher at the end, I think he deserved it just a little bit more,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;Its a huge win for him after winning his first Grand Slam this year, also to win his first Masters. To take the opportunities when theyre there, thats key in a tennis players career.&#8221; With the third-seeded Wawrinka serving for the match, Federer shouted in frustration as he missed an easy forehand on second serve at 15-15. On the next point, Federers backhand went wide and Wawrinka clinched the victory with a crisp forehand winner that landed on the line. The players, who are good friends, shared a warm hug at the net. &#8220;I had a great week here,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;Congratulations to Stan.&#8221; It is the seventh title of the 29-year-old Wawrinkas career, and his third this year. He lost his previous Masters finals at Madrid last year and Rome in 2008. Federer broke for a 3-2 lead when Wawrinkas backhand long, and served out the first set when his countryman over-hit another backhand. Wawrinka secured a break to take a 2-0 lead in the second, but Federer broke straight back with a brilliant passing shot down the line and confidently held to love to send the second set into a tiebreaker. But then he seemed to lose his way. One sloppy backhand from Federer allowed Wawrinka to move 2-0 ahead, and the Australian Open champion moved 4-1 up with a volley at the net. Federer saved two set points at 6-3 but Wawrinka levelled the match with a clinical smash after Federer had returned his serve a bit too high. &#8220;I dont think I served quite so well early on in the third set. I think he really found his range and started to hit bigger, deeper. He didnt miss that many second-serve returns anymore,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;He gave me a couple cheap points in the first couple sets which he later on really didnt give me anymore.&#8221; Federer was seeking the 79th title of his illustrious career, and his 22nd Masters trophy. The 32-year-old Swiss has lost three of his four finals this year, with the other defeats against Novak Djokovic at Indian Wells and to Lleyton Hewitt at Brisbane. &#8220;You must see the positive side. Try not to be disappointed or frustrated,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;What I see is that if Im in that position again, if I keep trying as I did, at a certain point its going to go my way. If you feel good mentally, then things are going to turn out good.&#8221; The next two Masters events on clay are at Madrid and Rome leading up to the French Open, which starts on May 25. <a href="http://www.dolphinsstore.us.com/Black-98-Jared-Odrick-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jared Odrick Dolphins Jersey</strong></a> .These are Cobains statistics: he had 13 hits (twelve singles and a double) in 40 at-bats with a .333 batting average. He had 7 RBIs, no home runs and only 1 error. Pretty impressive!Here is another picture of a 12-year-old Cobain on his team, the Elks, which is on display at the Hard Rock Café at Universal CityWalk in Hollywood:Lastly, here is a picture of Cobain from his junior high school wrestling team:Cobain also came up in an interview that Kenny Mayne conducted with with Pearl Jams Jeff Ament, a noted hoopshead like the rest of his band that was formerly named &#8220;Mookie Blaylock&#8221; in tribute to the former Atlanta Hawk, in ESPN The Magazine. <a href="http://www.dolphinsstore.us.com/Black-99-Jason-Taylor-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jason Taylor Dolphins Jersey</strong></a> . &#8212; Greg Norman hadnt played the Bob Hope Classic since 1986, and he had no plans to return to the Palm Springs deserts venerable tournament until Bill Clinton changed his mind.WASHINGTON &#8212; Wilson Ramos talked himself into the lineup. His calm approach at the plate took care of the rest. Ramos drove in four runs and Ian Desmond homered to help Jordan Zimmermann and the Washington Nationals beat the New York Mets 6-3 on Sunday. Desmonds solo shot tied the score in the second inning and Ramos two-run double in the third put the Nationals ahead for good. The catcher drove in two more with a bases-loaded single in the fifth off starter Zack Wheeler (1-4) for a 5-1 lead. &#8220;His heart rate doesnt increase,&#8221; Washington manager Matt Williams said of his cleanup hitter. &#8220;Thats key for anybody in the middle of the lineup driving in runs. &#8230; Its no different at-bat just because there are guys out there.&#8221; There was some debate about putting Ramos in the lineup for a third straight game, something he had not done since returning to action May 9. He missed more than a month with a hand injury and played only 78 games last year after multiple stints on the disabled list. &#8220;There was a conversation (Saturday) night about how he felt,&#8221; Williams said &#8220;He was adamant about playing today because he felt that it was coming along.&#8221; Though he was hitless in Saturdays 5-2 loss, Ramos sensed better days were ahead. On Sunday, he produced his first multihit game of the season. &#8220;Yesterday I was feeling good. I hit the ball well, &#8220;Ramos said. &#8220;I talked to (Williams) and said I want to play (Sunday). Every time I play games straight I feel better and better and better.&#8221; Zimmermann (3-1) allowed three runs and eight hits in six innings for his first win in three starts. It came hours after Washington put left-hander Gio Gonzalez on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his pitching shoulder. Drew Storen, Tyler Clippard and Rafael Soriano shut out the Mets over the final three innings. Washingtons bullpen pitched 13 scoreless innings in the series as the Nationals took two of three. Soriano worked the ninth for his 10th save. One day after New York snapped a nine-game losing streaak to the Nationals, a scuffling Wheeler gave up five runs &#8212; three earned &#8212; and six hits in six innings. <a href="http://www.dolphinsstore.us.com/Black-14-Jarvis-Landry-Womens-Jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jarvis Landry Dolphins Jersey</strong></a>. He struck out five and walked two. &#8220;Its been a bunch of bad starts in a row here,&#8221; said Wheeler, who has not won since April 14, &#8220;so I need to hurry up and turn it around and get back on the right track.&#8221; Results aside, manager Terry Collins liked what he saw from the 23-year-old righty. &#8220;Its all about locating his pitching. But I tell you, I thought he had really good stuff today, he just made a couple mistakes and they got some big hits,&#8221; Collins said. Juan Centeno hit a pair of RBI singles and Juan Lagares had a run-scoring single for the Mets, who have lost four of five. Washington is 5-1 against New York this season. The Mets scored twice against Zimmermann in the sixth, but the rally ended when Centeno was thrown out at second base after his run-scoring hit. All the New York momentum was stopped when the Nationals went to their bullpen. The Mets did not get a hit over the final three innings. &#8220;We feel very confident,&#8221; Clippard said. &#8220;Were kind of in that mode right now of just, get us the lead and well do our thing.&#8221; Zimmermann, a .385 hitter this season, singled in the fifth and later scored on Ramos base hit. Ramos doubled in two runs in the third after shortstop Ruben Tejadas fielding error with a runner on and two outs kept the inning going. Desmond has homered in back-to-back games. Kevin Frandsens RBI groundout in the eighth added an insurance run for Washington. NOTES: Gonzalez had an MRI. Results showed inflammation but no structural damage, Williams said. &#8230; The Nationals recalled RHP Ryan Mattheus from Triple-A Syracuse to replace Gonzalez on the roster. &#8230; New York RHP Rafael Montero (0-1) makes his second major league start Tuesday night against RHP Josh Beckett (1-2) and the Los Angeles Dodgers at Citi Field. &#8230; Washington RHP Stephen Strasburg (3-3) faces Cincinnati RHP Mike Leake (2-3) in the opener of a three-game series Monday night. &#8216; &#8216; &#8216;
