**GENERAL DESCRIPTION:**

Coruscant CRv is a solid, player friendly deck, which is able to disrupt your opponent in space or on the ground. It’s also one of the more NARP friendly decks, given that it requires less “finesse” than other decks. It also is probably the closest thing Dark Side has to a “TRM”-esque build, perhaps outside of Hunt Down. The version I will be discussing uses three effects, as well as the Special Edition, non-virtual version of Coruscant (which gives no icons to LS, which I think is the better option) The three effects that are most popular are as follows:

Combat Response v: Self-explanatory, when used in conjunction with Short Range Fighters combo, you can set up a fairly strong space presence.

Security Precautions v: Plus 1 for your initial activation doesn’t matter where you put it, with one caveat. Against WYS, you need to put it on a battleground, because once WYS flips, you have limited activation at your non BGs.

Imperial Arrest Order/Secret Plans: Primarily used to pull your docking bays, typically Coruscant DB and Executor DB. Both are non battlegrounds, and allow more of a force choke. Also gives you Nabrun protection and a “shield” (retrieval) in a deck that doesn’t use pullers (outside of maybe Myn v, more on that later)

**GENERAL STRATEGY:**

Set Up: You’re starting your Coruscant System, as well as Xizors Palace. Your set up is fairly rudimentary. Turn one, you’re getting your activation set up. You pull a docking bay using IAO (Imperial Arrest Order, which you started), and Xizor’s Palace, Uplink Station (Xizors Palace lets you download other Xizors Palace sites, but Uplink Station is the only available XP site as of this writing. Side note: This is more of a finesse move, but assuming you don’t have any docking bays in hand, you should declare your Docking Bay pull first. Since you are playing two, there’s more likely one in there. If you declare your XP pull first, you run a bigger chance of giving your opponent a free verify early on. Expert players can really thrive with the extra information.

It’s difficult to really explore a general strategy for such a broad deck that seeks to disrupt opponent, so I’ll go over strategy in more detail in the speficic matchup section.

The one thing I’ll add is this: Kashyyyk is a popular system include in this deck. It’s force drain plus 1, and the closest thing you’ll get to giving your opponent consistent damage (in a vacuum of course). Typically, you’ll want to get this out as quick as possible, and there are several key cards that can help you accomplish this. In my experience, the sooner I get out Kashyyyk and fortify, the better luck I have at winning (once again, TYPICALLY).

Coruscant CRv is incredibly strong late game, as your destinies are regularly 5’s and 6’s and can easily use weapons and clear sites with attrition.

<span style="font-size: 1rem">[wc_toggle title=&#8221;Key cards&#8221;]</span>

ADMIRALS ORDERS:

Black Sun Fleet: Definitely more on the bubble now with General Leia being popular, but a card that gives you some extra flexibility with moving Fett in space (or Maul) during your Control Phase. You could exclude this.

CHARACTERS:

Darth Maul with Lightsaber: Your main way of puttin’ a hurtin’ on the ground. Pack 3 and play accordingly. Depending on the matchup, you will put him in space on his ship, but rarely.

Mara Jade with Lightsaber: Another EPP that can make a character forfeit 0.

Emperor Palpatine: Strong on the ground, and on his ship. Depending on the matchup, you can place him in either theater accordingly. Also gives you reserve deck checks once per turn to check out your destinies. I play multiples.

Boba Fett v: Slave 1, Symbol of Fears matching pilot. Rarely used on the ground. His exchange a card feature is also a way to get Kashyyyk (should your other avenues fall short).

Count Dooku: Hard to kill, and helps with activation. Play one or two

Grand Moff Tarkin v: Flexible character, but better in space, where he typically gets the protection from attrition, whether he’s joining Vader on the shuttle, Fett on Slave 1, or Emperor’s Shuttle (for the maximum space benefit).

Dr. E and Ponda Baba: Operates characters, not much to be said here. In space heavy matchups, he/they are good forfeit fodder in battles against opponents drawing multiple destinies in space.

P-59: Shoots vehicles and draws on his own, and has token immunity.

Baron Soontir Fel: Matching pilot for Saber 1, especially deadly with Dark Maneuvers and Short Range Fighters combo.

Darth Vader v: This is more preference, but he is incredibly strong in space. You obviously have the opportunity cost of a top 3 ground character, but he synergizes well with the space package, and reduces destinies in space.

Director Orson Krennic: A popular include with Jyn being in every deck, and also adds when with Tarkin. You could swap him out for someone else if you want.

Dengar with Blaster Carbine v: Another guy who can shoot at vehicles.

Myn Kyneugh v: A popular addition lately, as he functions as a token shield pull and a token grabber. Also a leader, so you can get the Tarkin bonus.

Lord Sidious: Another bubble character, but I like him to lock down a site and exclude a character. Against WHAP, you don’t need to have him by himself in order to exclude (I think?). Prefer to have a Ghhhk in case LS overcommits to his site. Watch out for the shield which makes you lose 2 force for excluding.

(THERE ARE A DOZEN OTHERS YOU CAN ADD, OTHER PLAYERS CAN FEEL FREE TO ADD TO THIS LIST IN THE THREAD)

INTERRUPTS

Point Man: Definitely one of my favorites, great for finding a card you need (Kashyyyk early on), but also lets you put those high destinies back in there (Phantom Menace, Image of the Dark Lord etc…). I am not a fan of 4-Lom v in this deck, so Point Man is my way of putting cards back. Also, cancels the very widely used Keep Your Eyes Open v (which is fairly annoying against your main ground force, Darth Maul with Lightsaber)

Force Push v: Don’t need to go into specifics, helps you pull a card from your force pile. Another way to get Kashyyyk should the game warrant it.

Force Field v: Keeps your character safe from weapons, and keeps those higher forfeits in tact.

A Dark Time for the Rebellion v: Definitely a bubble card with TRM losing some ground to Hitco, but also good for Wedge RSL shenanigans (mainly in OA, which is also less likely to be played due to MAP).

Dark Maneuvers: Easy destiny six card to keep pumping back into your deck. I’ve had this card grabbed a few times, and I consider it a win/win). Also can clear a lot of stuff when used with Saber 1 and a Short Range Fighters combo

Neimodian Advisor: Used to pull Kashyyyk only. Once you get it out, it’s easy to pitch for force loss.

Masterful Move or Masterful Move Combo: I have lately switched to the combo version, which is a slightly lower destiny, but cancels Celebration (mainly used in QMC and some Diplo). Either way, it’s a high destiny which pulls your Ghhhk, Image of the Dark Lord v or The Phantom Menace.

Ghhhk: Overflow protection

Force Lightning: Play 1 or 2…if opponent has already grabbed an interrupt it’s good to cycle using another character present with the Emperor. You then get free verifications every turn without letting your opponent see. If Palpatine or Dooku is locking down a drain site, you can use it on Jyn.

Short Range Fighters & Watch Your Back: Probably the most important interrupt in the deck. In conjunction with Combat Response, essential in setting up your rather formidable space package where you see fit. This is probably going to be the card that is grabbed, so if you get one turn 1, use it to get a ship (I grab Vader’s shuttle as my first ship). If they grab something else, (especially if they’re ground based), you can throw these 5’s back into your deck with the used function.

Close Call v: Good utility card, but low destiny. Especially good in space, where your ships all have immunity of less than 5.

Imbalance Combo: Best used to protect against Sorry About the Mess. If you anticipate a lot of heavy mains, you can play 2.

LOCATIONS:

Coruscant and Executor Docking Bays: Pullable with your staring effect

Kashyyyk: See above

Xizors Palace Uplink Station: Pullable with your starting Xizors Palace site.

STARSHIPS/VEHICLES:

Saber 1: For Baron Soontir Fell, best ship to use Short Range Fighters combo lost function on.

Slave 1, Symbol of Fear: Boba’s ship, put him on there.

Maul’s Sith Infiltrator: Not used a ton, since your Maul is best used on the ground, but can be useful depending on your opponent. Also a great candidate to put back with Point Man since it’s a destiny 6.

Emperor’s Personal Shuttle: Palpatine is going to be used on the ground a bunch, and this ship isn’t pullable by Short Range Fighters (since it has a permanent pilot), but it is absolute monster with Palpatine and Tarkin on board (three destinies and immune to attrition), you can kill a non-loaded Home One fairly easily. Make sure you have 2 force saved to put Palpatine on, since you’re likely to see a Goldenrod shield played

Vader’s Personal Shuttle v: Probably the first ship you should pull, since Vader draws on his own, you get immunity and you can remove 2 from opponent’s destiny.

Blizzard 4: Pulls an Imperial Warrior. Great for clearing a lone EPP with a lightsaber, but also watch out for the Goldenrod Shield if you want to put a guy on there.

EFFECTS:

Won’t be mentioning the starting effects again. See above for their description.

Tarkin’s Bounty: Free force pile pull. On Grand Moff Tarkin, you can peek at your top card. Late game, you can use this to take a peek at your card, and if it’s a low destiny, use Palpatine to shuffle it away for a chance at a higher destiny. But that’s a luxury option.

Image of the Dark Lord: Force drain minus 1, pullable with Masterful Move, high destiny, which is a good candidate for putting in Used with Point Man early on.

Lateral Damage: I put this back in there with the amount of DIPLO I’ve been seeing, and it’s really paying dividends. LS has a handful of options to cancel Lateral Damage, but early on, it can really disrupt their flow. And a lot of the time, you put it on Coruscant and the LS can’t get there in one turn. But this is a judgement call on your part.

Something Special Planned for Them v: Another grabber. Late game, if the grabbed card has little utility for the LS, I typically use it to retrieve Maul’s Sith Infiltrator and put another 6 back into my reserve.

The Phantom Menace: 1 or 2 copies. Great for making Maul a machine, and great for putting back with Point Man should your opponent not be playing any Jedi. Although it goes back to your Used pile when Maul dies, so you can use Maul, clear a site, and then forfeit (assuming no LS jedi present) to put it back.

Imperial Justice v: Great card, especially when used in Space with the lost function of Short Range Fighters combo (substituting a destiny is not considered “drawing”, so you will still get 2 destiny to your opponent’s one, assuming they don’t use Darklighter Spin, which is the LS equivalent to Short Range Fighters).

Imperial Decree v: If you’re anticipating WHAP/Profit, this card is a must include to reduce those pings.

[wc_toggle title=&#8221;**Matchups**&#8220;]

Diplomatic Mission to Alderaan (DIPLO):

What DIPLO does well against Coruscant CRv:

Diplo has a fairly strong package when fully set up, so you won’t be able to spread as easily in space, and Kashyyyk might not be best deployed. Keep in mind you will need Fett and Slave 1 (or Maul in ship) at Tatooine in order to draw multiple destinies. Once flipped, it’s hard to keep any of your guys on the table due to attrition.

What Coruscant CRv does well against DIPLO

Coruscant CRv has a fairly strong chance to disrupt the delivery of the Death Star Plans, and thus prevent flipping. Their ground is severely compromised without the ability to add to total battle destiny.

General Strategy against DIPLO:

Keep the pressure on them in Space. Kashyyyk is not as necessary here, since you can drain at Tatooine for 2. If they flip, attack at their weakest spot and hope for overflow. Diplo gives you a TON of icons, so you should have a lot of force. DIPLO has a ton of builds, so adjust accordingly.

Old Allies (OA):

What OA does well against Coruscant CRv:

The space package is fairly strong, and once fully set up, you will have trouble keeping pace with them. If you’re playing against a Speeders and Admiral’s Orders heavy build, you will have trouble clearing them off sites, especially when they’re in speeders. Dengar and P-59 are of paramount importance. Use Imperial Justice in space, as Poe/Ackbar/Solo/Rey can potentially result in multiple destinies. If you can lock down the Graveyard, you could do a lot worse, but watch out for It’s A Hit if they have locked down OA. If they’re flipped, Jakku can “out damage” you generally speaking.

What Coruscant CRv does well against OA:

If you set up your space early enough, they will have some trouble, but don’t get too greedy. If they’re not flipped, you can have an easier time killing their speeders with your guys, but you’ll have trouble late game if they are flipped.

General strategy against OA: Once again, keep the pressure on. They won’t benefit too much from coming to Coruscant, but they could put someone their late game for extra drains, keep someone available in case they try it.

He Is the Chosen One (Hitco)/Throne Room Mains

What Hitco/TRM does well against Coruscant CRv: Mains are more built for ground, and will be coming to Coruscant to challenge you. They have just as many tricks as you do, and are built to last on the ground. You’ll typically have to have the ‘right cards’ in order to win battles, for example, Darth Maul with Lightsaber will wanting to have The Phantom Menace (or Dr. E/Ponda) on the table in order to do real damage.

What Coruscant CRv does well against Mains: Your space is infinitely superior, so you shouldn’t have too much to worry about there. Your ground is just as capable as theirs, but you’ll have to anticipate tricks, anything that messes with destinies, weapons etc… for Hitco, you won’t have to worry about them staying flipped too long, as you are chalk full of Dark Jedi.

General Strategy against Mains: Get Kashyyyk set up and start draining them for 2 each turn. Keep your Emperor on the ground, and make sure your Maul has some help (but watch out for Clash of Sabers!). Late game if their character base is thin, take over the Jedi Council Chamber for some major damage, Palpatine/Dooku is great here.

Profit:

What Profit does well against Coruscant CRv: They have the character base and enough tricks to really put a hurting on you (especially at the Audience Chamber should you insufficiently enforce it). Since they’re not really concerned with space, you can’t spread as thinly on the ground. If they set up “A Gift”, they’ll hurt you in every aspect of the game so long as you have aliens at locations.

What Coruscant CRv does well against Profit: You have a lot of heavy hitters to throw down at the Audience Chamber, so if you get set up early enough. Since you start with a Nabrun hating shield (IAO allows them only to use Nabrun during the move phase), you neuter a big part of the general Profit strategy.

General Strategy against Profit: Get Kashyyyk set up and start draining them for 2 each turn. Typically you’ll want to put Mara Jade and Dr. E combo at the Audience chamber, but anticipate Master Luke making Dr. E disappear. Get Palpatine to the Audience Chamber ASAP, as you can Force Lightning Threepio (if he’s undercover using “A Gift”) and not be forced to compromise where you put your alien characters. If you can keep them unflipped, you should win this matchup without much difficulty (especially if you get Kashyyyk out early!).

WYS:

What WYS does well against Coruscant CRv: WYS has a fairly strong space package which can go toe to toe with your space package, and enough tricks with interrupts to clear your characters while saving theirs. Jedi Luke to the Cantina is fairly routine, and they have enough tricks to keep pinging you to death with heavy force drains.

What Coruscant CRv does well against WYS: You have the right ingredients to kill Jedi Luke (Maul with The Phantom Menace on the table is a solid option), and enough to stay dangerous in space. Be careful with your shield play, as you’ll need the WYS shield to even have a chance (pull it the second they flip). You may also want to consider the “Dodge Shield” (Death Star Sentry I believe?) since WYS likes to control the board rather than battling. This is an ideal deck to justify your multiple grabbers (the shield, Something Special v, and Myn v).

General Strategy against WYS: If you can put together the right cards to kill Jedi Luke, it will be really hard for WYS to keep up once he’s off the table. Be judicious with your shield pulls. Dash in Outrider is fairly disruptive, so you may be forced to overcommit to a location in space. While your space is intimidating, Moving to Attack Position can also disrupt your plans to get rid of some of their guys. They get forfeit bonuses from their smugglers, so overflow isn’t as common unless you hit them with weapons. (I AM PROBABLY .500 IN THIS MATCHUP, SO PLEASE ADD ANYTHING YOU FEEL MAY BE HELPFUL)

Quiet Mining Colony (QMC):

What QMC does well against Coruscant CRv:

QMC doesn’t love battling as much, and has lots of evasion tricks. Once flipped, they really can respond to the cards you have on the table with their force pile pulls. They have a solid space package.

What Coruscant CRv does well against QMC:

You’re built for battling, and your space is better. It’s harder to pull off, but you can disrupt their ability to flip by coming at Harc with the right play on turn 1. Depending on their space package, you may be able to get your drains in on Bespin and Kashyyyk.

General Strategy against QMC:

If you get a chance, take out Harc early. Keep pressure on at Bespin. (I HAVE PLAYED THIS MATCHUP ONCE, WHERE I PREVENTED A FLIP WITH A QUICK HARC BLOWOUT, PLEASE ADD YOUR THOUGHTS).
