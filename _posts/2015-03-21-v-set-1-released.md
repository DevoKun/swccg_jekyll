Greetings, Star Wars players!

I am pleased to present to you Set 1.  While I&#8217;ve had the privilege of being the main &#8220;face&#8221; of this set, a lot goes into it.  I want to give thanks to the many people behind the scenes who help keep the game alive.

In no particular order, I want to thank the Design Interns (Jarad, Ryan, Seth, but also Brad and Matt); the Development team, all of our dedicated testers, Jeremy, the proofing team, my fellow advocates, and most of all, the players as a whole.  Without you guys running events and playing in them, there is little chance we would all be here still pouring time into a long out of print game.

As to the PDF, it should be largely what you guys are expecting.  We are working on some AIs for some of the cards, so stay tuned for those.  The big change/absence from this PDF is Count Dooku. After talking it over w/ the interns and the other advocates, we want to explore addressing Dooku via making a new Force Lightning (V) and potentially removing all references to FL on him- but not right now.  This actually was suggested in Design late in the set, and I didn&#8217;t move forward on it since it seemed to be too big of a change at the time.  The plan for now is to shelve the proposed errata for a time, probably until Set 2 comes around but maybe sooner.  We plan to use this time to observe him more, and then ultimately to decide on how and if to errata him in conjunction with this new design.  The idea was that we are going to get more Dark Jedi in the game, over time, and especially with new trilogy coming out.  We likely would want to have something that works with them that doesn&#8217;t require us to keep saying &#8220;May be targeted by Force Lightning&#8221; over and over again.  Pushing the errata as proposed through now could pigeonhole us from exploring a Force Lightning type card down the road, and we didn&#8217;t want to errata Dooku twice if we didn&#8217;t have to.  This will give us time to gather any data that might come out of upcoming events, and give us time to test the changes so we can be confident we are making the right move.

So have fun as we all prepare for Spring events, feel free to keep on using the Set 1 Forum to discuss cards, decks, and strategies, and most of all, keep on playing!
