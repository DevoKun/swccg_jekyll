**General description**

Old Allies is a control style deck. It relies heavily on flipping the objective, using the 7-side bonuses and often focusing its forces on Jakku. It has very few bad matchups, and if played correctly will be slightly favored in most matchups. It is not an easy deck to play though.

Character restrictions on the 0-side and bonuses on the 7-side decide many of the cards that are included in the deck. But the last 20 or so cards are what makes the deck work well or not so well against different decks.

The two popular versions of OA plays different starting interrupts, either a 12-card start (using Don’t Tread On Me as Starting Interrupt) or a 3 effect start (using Heading for the Medical Frigate as Starting Interrupt). Both versions rely on speeders.

**General strategy**

Setup: Your initial target is to flip as early as possible without leaving your forces spread too thin. In most games, your flip is accomplished by moving the Falcon to Jakku, putting cards with ability on 2 sites and then consolidate your forces on one of those sites. There are games when you want to keep Falcon on the ground though, and will be in need of another ship to flip. Luckily, Profundity can fulfill that role.

Midgame: Once you are flipped, you will need to setup strongly on Jakku in order to maximize the use of the damage reduction on the 7-side of your objective. Speeders are a good way of protecting your weak characters from weapons, but the speeders are vulnerable to some weapons. Your space package should be a mix of Home One, Profundity and Falcon. OA (like many LS decks) will rely on tricks to keep their characters, ships and vehicles alive in the mid-game, such as Rebel Leadership v and Keep Your Eyes Open v.

The game will take a few different directions mid-game depending on the matchup. Either DS will attack you all over Jakku, just the systems or just the sites. Very rarely can DS afford to ignore you completely.  
Likewise, you cannot afford to ignore DS, despite all damage reduction you can pack into a deck.

Late game: At this point, you should make sure to control 2 Jakku locations during opponent’s control phase, regardless of which direction the mid-game went. Key cards to reduce damage and get cards back are We’re Doomed, It Could Be Worse, Weapons Display v and General Leia. OA rarely wins by 20 plus cards, but can often grind out games that are close.

<strong class="text-strong">Characters:</strong>

<strong class="text-strong">Resistance characters:</strong>  
In order to use the 7-side of the objective, you need to play Resistance characters. So far, there has been a limited number of Resistance characters released, but with every set, that number is increased.

• [Rey](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/rey.gif){.postlink}  
The most important character in the deck. She is pulled for 2 Force, can pilot the Falcon and will give tons of card advantage over the course of the game. Play 2x.

• [Solo](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/solo.gif){.postlink}  
Adds a battle destiny with Rey or Chewie, draws if unable to otherwise and gets an Interrupt from Lost Pile. Almost as important as Rey. Should probably be played 2x as well.

• [Chewie With Bowcaster](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/chewiewithbowcaster.gif){.postlink}  
Can shoot vehicles. High deploy and low defense value makes him a little less attractive option than Solo and Rey.

• [Poe Dameron](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/poedameron.gif){.postlink}  
A fantastic pilot, adds a battle destiny when piloting and immunity to attrition. Should be played 2x as he can be used on both ships and speeders.

• [General Leia Organa](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual7-Light/large/generalleiaorgana.gif){.postlink}  
Basically replaced every other Leia in the deck. Great stats, retrieval, works with Rebel Leadership v and pulled with Strike Planning. Can also be played 2x.

• [Lor San Tekka](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/lorsantekka.gif){.postlink}  
Ability 4, card manipulation, high destiny. Interesting control phase movement that can be important late game.

• [Finn](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/finn.gif){.postlink}  
Useful utility character, especially when deployed as a react. His immunity is surprisingly good.

• [Admiral U.O. Statura](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual8-Light/large/admiraluostatura.gif){.postlink}  
Very good game text but his lack of piloting skills makes him a fringe character. Works with Leadership v in space though.

• [Major Harter Kalonia](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual8-Light/large/majorharterkalonia.gif){.postlink}  
Good text, but bad stats makes her a 61st card.

<strong class="text-strong">Rebels, aliens and republicans:</strong>  
As you can only run a limited number of Resistance characters you will need to fill up the rest of the character slots with rebels, aliens and republic characters. The low destiny characters are usually pulled, and most other characters have good destiny, and Jedi Levitation v can further improve the average destiny in the deck after a few turns.

• [Admiral Ackbar v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual3-Light/large/admiralackbar.gif){.postlink}  
Key card for space battles, due to deploy cost and Rebel Leadership v. Also good with Home One: War Room to reduce Home One’s deploy cost.

• [Anakin Skywalker](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/anakinskywalkerpadawanlearner.gif){.postlink}  
Sometimes used as a good pilot and high-ability character. Pretty bad against Hunt Down though.

• [Captain Hera Syndulla](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/captainherasyndulla.gif){.postlink}  
The GMTv mirror is pretty good in a deck that will play 5-10 rebels in an already Imperial heavy meta.

• [Corran Horn](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/corranhorn.gif){.postlink}  
Important card, otherwise Undercover spies can shut down most of your drains.

• [First Officer Thaneespi](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/firstofficerthaneespi.gif){.postlink}  
Very good with Ackbar v and Haash’n. Good stats, female (works with I Can Take Care Of Myself) and the Zuckuss ability can be huge.

• [General Calrissian](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/generalcalrissian.gif){.postlink}  
Good choice to pull with Strike Planning to give Rey a co-pilot for the Falcon. Works with Rebel Leadership v too.

• [General Crix Madine](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Endor-Light/large/generalcrixmadine.gif){.postlink}  
Can be used with Strike Planning, especially if you want to run a couple scouts, like Lieutenant Blount vs ISB.

• [General Solo v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/generalsolo.gif){.postlink}  
Not as good as Solo, but can be an option.

• [Harc Seff v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/harcseff.gif){.postlink}  
Less impactful after the errata, but still very good against some decks.

• [Jyn Erso](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual6-Light/large/jynerso.gif){.postlink}  
Useful in general. Great with Bacta Tank, could played 2x in fear of MAP.

• [Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/landocalrissianscoundrel.gif){.postlink}  
Good alternative to General Calrissian, especially if you don’t play Strike Planning.

• [Leia, Rebel Princess](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/leiarebelprincess.gif){.postlink}  
Still a good Leia, despite the General version being so good.

• [Major Haash’n](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/majorhaashn.gif){.postlink}  
Lateral protection, low deploy cost, adds hyperspeed and works with Thaneespi. Competes with Theron Nett v for a spot.

• [Padmé Naberrie v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual3-Light/large/padmenaberrie.gif){.postlink}  
Very good in the meta with Vader being common.

• [Theron Nett v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/theronnett.gif){.postlink}  
Maul protection and weapon protection. Rogue Squadron pilot as well.

• [Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/wedgeantillesredsquadronleader.gif){.postlink}  
A staple in the deck. Works with anyone piloting a speeder, Corran and Theron. Watch out for Vader, Enforcer.

<strong class="text-strong">Droids and other lower life forms:</strong>

• [2-1B](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/21btooonebee.gif){.postlink} or [FX-7](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/fx7effexseven.gif){.postlink}  
If you play Bacta Tank, those are interesting choices to make the Tank even more efficient.

• [Jar Jar Binks](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/jarjarbinks.gif){.postlink}  
Interesting meta choice against CCT and TTO.

• [Threepio With His Parts Showing](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/threepiowithhispartsshowingai.gif){.postlink}  
Important card for the deck, especially late game when you need to loop important interrupts. Put him on a spaceship if possible to protect him from Force Lightning and Restraining Bolt.

[/wc\_accordion\_section]

<strong class="text-strong">Starships:</strong>

One of the biggest strengths of OA is starting the Falcon. But the Falcon is not enough to occupy or control systems so 2 or 3 more ships are essential.

• [Home One](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/homeone.gif){.postlink}  
The most commonly played ship in OA (well, except for the Falcon…). Launching the Assault can be pulled by Wokling v. If you run 12-card, you can run either 2 x Launching or 2 x Home One.

• [Profundity](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual7-Light/large/Profundity.gif){.postlink}  
Can be pulled with Rebellions Are Built On Hope, another effect you can start. Cheap deploy and works well with the Mon Calamari fish package (Haash’n, Ackbar v, Thaneespi).

• [Tantive IV v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual1-Light/large/tantiveiv.gif){.postlink}  
Decent meta option against TTO, MAP and SYCFA. Fly Casual can pull it.

• [Obi-Wan In Radiant VII](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/obiwaninradiantvii.gif){.postlink}  
Prevents Maul from cloaking, has good stats and a pilot slot.

<strong class="text-strong">Interrupts:</strong>  
OA relies on several interrupts, many of them defensive. OA can run up to 20 interrupts.

• Alter ([v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/alterpremiere.gif){.postlink} or [non-v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/alter.gif){.postlink})  
Just as for many other LS decks, OA want to remove annoying effects from table and cancel Sense. Effects to remove include Broken Concentration, Strategic Reserves v, Scum and Villainy, Blast Door Controls, Sunsdown combo and Lateral Damage.

• [Antilles Maneuver v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/antillesmaneuver.gif){.postlink}  
Weapons protection, pulls Haash’n and Theron Nett v. Also very good late game to track a destiny 5. Can be 2x in a deck.

• [Are You Okay?](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/areyouokay.gif){.postlink}  
Marginally useful, at least late game.

• [Control & Tunnel Vision](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/control&tunnelvision.gif){.postlink}  
OA needs to find different cards for different matchups, and Tunnel Vision can be huge. The Control part helps a lot against early pressure. Can be run 2x.

• [Hear Me Baby, Hold Together v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual1-Light/large/hearmebabyholdtogether.gif){.postlink}  
Cancels Hidden Weapons and gets you a shield.

• [Houjix](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ANewHope-Light/large/houjix.gif){.postlink} and [Escape Pod & We’re Doomed](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/escapepodweredoomed.gif){.postlink}  
Self-explanatory if you want to run them. We’re Doomed combo makes less sense in OA as you reduce damage with 7-side.

• [I Can Take Care Of Myself](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual7-Light/large/icantakecareofmyself.gif){.postlink}  
OA runs a few females, and this card both protects them from weapons and provides a much needed drain bonus (in a deck otherwise lacking in that area). Can be played 2x.

• [Inconsequential Barriers](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/inconsequentialbarriers.gif){.postlink}  
Important if you are worried about Set For Stun ruining your day.

• [It Could Be Worse](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/itcouldbeworse.gif){.postlink}  
Watch out for It’s Worse. Try to have It’s A Hit! In hand when relying on it. Or use it as first action in opponent’s Control Phase (so you can use the 7 side of the objective on It’s Worse) OR use it on a Force Drain with Ultimatum on table, so you can’t lose more than 2.

• [It’s A Hit!](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/OfficialTournamentSealedDeck-Light/large/itsahit.gif){.postlink}  
Cancels a bunch of annoying interrupts, mainly Elis Helrot. Drain cancelling is huge in some matchups. Can be run 2x.

• [Jedi Levitation v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/jedilevitation.gif){.postlink}  
Bunch of key characters in the deck, very good.

• [Keep Your Eyes Open v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/keepyoureyesopen.gif){.postlink}  
A must have, probably 2x. TTO plays a bunch of space weapons, and you want to protect your speeders.

• [Perimeter Scan v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual1-Light/large/perimeterscan.gif){.postlink}  
Alternative to Hear Me Baby v, if you are more worried about Trample and Maintenance cards than Hidden Weapons.

• [Rebel Barrier](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/rebelbarrier.gif){.postlink}  
Don’t rely too much on this, but it can be fantastic for a defensive-minded deck like OA.

• [Rebel Leadership v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual3-Light/large/rebelleadership.gif){.postlink}  
Staple. Run 3-4x.

• [They’re Tracking Us v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual7-Light/large/theyretrackingus.gif){.postlink}  
Program Trap can be annoying, so a good utility interrupt for OA.

• [We’re Doomed](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/weredoomed.gif){.postlink}  
Self-explanatory.

• [Were You Looking For Me?](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Endor-Light/large/wereyoulookingforme.gif){.postlink}  
Gets the naked guy.

• [Wesa Gotta Grand Army](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/wesagottagrandarmy.gif){.postlink}  
12-card version can run this.

• [You Do Have Your Moments v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/youdohaveyourmoments.gif){.postlink}  
Good card for OA, with 7 side.

• [Yoda Stew & You Do Have Your Moments](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/yodastew&youdohaveyourmoments.gif){.postlink}  
Good against Broken Concentration, and opponent getting a bunch of attrition against you (like DS Senate).

<strong class="text-strong">Effects:</strong>

OA typically runs few effects, apart from the ones you can start. A 12-card version will run even less.

• [Bacta Tank](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/bactatank.gif){.postlink}  
Great card, especially when you reach the “control” part of the game. Watch out for Cold Feet v.

• [Echo Base Garrison](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/echobasegarrison.gif){.postlink}  
If you run more than 2 speeders, this is a decent choice.

• [Evacuation Control v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/evacuationcontrol.gif){.postlink}  
Powerful against Senate and BHBM especially.

• [Ounee Ta](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/JabbasPalaceSealedDeck-Light/large/ouneeta.gif){.postlink}  
Get a key card back from Lost Pile.

• [Launching The Assault](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/launchingtheassault.gif){.postlink}  
Gets you Home One, and gives you drain bonus.

• [Rebellions Are Built On Hope](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual7-Light/large/rebellionsarebuiltonhope.gif){.postlink}  
Pulls Profundity, which is key against Court. Can also give you a little activation boost.

• [Strike Planning](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/strikeplanning.gif){.postlink}  
Key card if you run 3 effect start. Calrissian and Organa are the most common pulls.

• [Why Does Everyone Want To Go Back To Jakku?!](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual8-Light/large/whydoeseveryonewanttogobacktojakku.gif){.postlink}  
Interesting card for a different take on OA.

• [Wokling v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/wokling.gif){.postlink}  
Important for the 3 effect start.

• [You’ve Got A Lot Of Guts Coming Here](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/youvegotalotofgutscominghere.gif){.postlink}  
If you are expecting a lot of Scum, this is decent. Depending on your deck, 6-7 characters in the deck can get a bonus from it as well.

<strong class="text-strong">Locations:</strong>  
Your objective will pull most of your locations, but you will most certainly run at least on non-Jakku location to get enough activation.

• [Home One: War Room](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/homeonewarroom.gif){.postlink}  
A very useful location to run 1-2 of, partly because OA needs about 2 more activation in total, and partly because deploying Home One for -5 is amazing.

• [Jakku](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/jakku.gif){.postlink}  
Starting location with great text.

• [Jakku: Docking Bay](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual7-Light/large/jakkudockingbay.gif){.postlink}  
Pretty good, but not that important. Don’t forget the +1 activation from RABOH. Gives you a second site to land and take off for free.

• [Jakku: Niima Outpost Shipyard](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/jakkuniimaoutpostshipyard.gif){.postlink}  
Starting location, good text.

• [Jakku: Rey’s Encampment](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/jakkureysencampment.gif){.postlink}  
Interior site, that pulls Rey. Auto-include.

• [Jakku: Starship Graveyard](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/jakkustarshipgraveyard.gif){.postlink}  
2/2 site with great text. Don’t forget to use the game text if you can (retrieve 3PO when you deploy Rey for example)

• [Jakku: Tuanul Village](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual4-Light/large/jakkutuanulvillage.gif){.postlink}  
Good against Map (convert their site) and 2/1 is better than the docking bay early on.

• [Naboo: Boss Nass’ Chambers](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/naboobossnassschambers.gif){.postlink}  
Only played with Wesa.

• [Kiffex](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/JabbasPalace-Light/large/kiffex.gif){.postlink} or another system  
Potentially OA could play another system, but that is a meta call. Either as a system to run away to, or because you are stronger in space and can hold 2 systems.

<strong class="text-strong">Weapons and devices:</strong>

OA runs very few, if any, weapons and devices. That could change once more Resistance cards have been released.

• [Han’s Toolkit](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/hanstoolkit.gif){.postlink}  
Very powerful tool to protect your speeders from Crash Landing and Sunsdown combo.

<strong class="text-strong">Vehicles:</strong>  
Speeders are very useful for OA to protect key characters, and move all over Jakku, and extra powerful with Wedge Antilles.

• [Dash In Rogue 10](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual1-Light/large/dashinrogue10.gif){.postlink}  
Built-in immunity, probably the best speeder.

• [Rogue 1](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/rogue1.gif){.postlink}  
Good stats make this a preferred 2nd choice of speeder.

• [Rogue 3](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/rogue3.gif){.postlink}  
If you run more than 2 speeders, this is a definite choice.

<strong class="text-strong">Admiral’s Orders:</strong>  
With the emergence of General Leia, OA is less likely to run AOs. But it could still make sense to run [Combined Fleet Action](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/combinedfleetaction.gif){.postlink} as that is a very powerful card when played with speeders.

Cards to look out for and their counters:

OA is a very powerful deck in the right hands. However, there are plenty of cards and combos that are bad for the deck.

Ridiculous card against vehicle Falcon and speeders as it makes it super easy to hit them with weapons. The main reason to play Han’s Toolkit and Alter.

• [Crash Landing](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Hoth-Dark/large/crashlanding.gif){.postlink}  
Another too powerful counter. Toolkit helps. Speeders can be a bit silly themselves, but counters like Crash Landing and Sunsdown combo are too much of a blowout.

• [P-59](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/p59.gif){.postlink} & [Dengar With Blaster Carbine v](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual0-Dark/large/dengarwithblastercarbine.gif){.postlink}

Can cancel Wedge’s game text. Makes Padmé more important.

• [Control & Set For Stun](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsII-Dark/large/control&setforstun.gif){.postlink}  
Usually targets characters aboard your ships (like Theron Nett v or Ackbar v) so DS can use their weapons or multiple battle destinies in space. Inconsequential Barriers is your friend here.

• [Lateral Damage](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Premiere-Dark/large/lateraldamage.gif){.postlink}  
Blowout card in space. Haash’n and Alter helps here.

o Some decks like CCT and FO Trooper decks rely on beatdowns, so watch out for a big Elis move. It’s A Hit! from hand (or Lost Pile with Solo) can be important.

[wc_toggle title=&#8221;**Matchups**&#8220;]

OA has a general plan of flipping early and (ab-)using the objective, but a lot of other decisions are very match up dependent. The following section deals with most matchups in the current meta.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Dark/large/thatthingsoperational.gif">That Thing’s Operational</a> (TTO)</strong>  
• TTO is a space deck with control elements, using the power of TTO to deal tons of damage.  
• Strong, fast space package. Pulls most of its activation.  
• Superlaser Mark II and TIE cannons can wreak havoc in space.

What TTO does well against OA:  
• Sets up somewhat risk free as the Falcon is on Jakku, and OA usually don’t run many spies and/or Jar Jar.  
• Space weapons and multiple battle destinies can make contesting Jakku difficult for OA.

What OA does well against TTO:  
• Damage reduction on the 7 side is important against TTO.  
• Destiny reduction, multiple Rebel Leadership v and weapons protection can help win space.  
• Flips early, but it should not come at a cost of spreading too thin.  
• Speeders are hard to kill for TTO.

General strategy:  
• Flip as fast and safely as possible.  
• Get Falcon and another ship in space, with weapons protection handy. But don’t forget to protect your sites, as TTO will punish you as soon as you spread too thin.  
• Use the move phase correctly, so you control two Jakku sites in opponent’s control phase. Consider running 4x Jakku sites to simplify this.  
• Key cards for the matchup are ships with their pilots, Keep Your Eyes Open v, Antilles Maneuver v, Theron Nett v, Rebel Leadership v and We’re Doomed. The matchup is a pretty even one.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual1-Dark/large/imperialentanglements.gif">Imperial Entanglements</a> (IE)</strong>  
• IE is, like OA, a control deck that plays on multiple sites and its related system.  
• IE sets up 2 powerful Star Destroyers early on, and is difficult to contest on the Tatooine sites.  
• IE sets up Tatooine Occupation with ease, and has a powerful 7 side.

What IE does well against OA:  
• Can go to Jakku turn 1 with Devastator for early pressure, making it difficult to flip with Falcon. Can add Flagship Executor as well if needed (hyperspeed 2 makes it difficult to move between Jakku and Tatooine though).  
• AT-STs and AT-ATs are good at fighting on Jakku sites.

What OA does well against IE:  
• Once OA flip, they can negate Occupation damage.  
• OA needs a lot of Force activated in order to do what it wants to do, and IE gives away 5, which helps a lot.  
• Many of the strengths of IE are the same strengths OA has. Starts a ship on table, powerful 7 side, plays big capital starships with Rebel Leadership v, can occupy multiple battleground locations.

General strategy:  
• Find a good spot to flip. Devastator to Jakku forces you to flip with another ship.  
• If IE mostly ignores you, you will need to fight on Tatooine sites. If they attack on Jakku, you will need to find defensive cards, like Bacta Tank, Rebel Leadership v, Barriers etc.  
• In my opinion OA is slightly favored against IE as long as you can abuse damage reduction. IE in the hands of a good player might disagree.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/isboperations.gif">ISB Operations</a> (ISB)</strong>  
• Usually sets up a big blue space package, and a bunch of agents on Vehicles and Star Destroyers.  
• Gets drain bonus from the objective, while reducing yours.  
• Very much a control deck, thriving on negating any damage LS does, while trying to get some drains in here and there, and retrieving an agent per turn.

What ISB does well against OA:  
• Negates a lot of the damage OA can deal.  
• Very difficult to kill the ships and vehicles, with agents like Tarkin v, Treidum v and Kallus onboard.

What OA does well against ISB:  
• ISB is slow, so OA can set up somewhat safely early on.  
• The space package is evenly matched, and usually space is decided on who sets up faster and finds the Commands/Leaderships.  
• While ISB can be tough to clear of the Jakku sites, the same can be said of OA. The difficulties lie in doing damage, not surviving at locations.

General strategy:  
• Flip fast. Find space cards.  
• Depending on what counters you run, you need to find those. .  
• Try to win space battles. If ISB wants to survive in space against a loaded Home One package, they have to put cards like Tarkin v in space. That makes it somewhat easier to battle on the ground.  
• ISB is slightly favored, but OA can run counters like Chewie with Bowcaster, Menace Fades, Mechanical Failure and Lieutenant Blount to help with the matchup. Try to find ways to deal extra damage, like Corran Horn to a non-battleground late game.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/invasion.gif">Invasion</a></strong>  
• Invasion uses a bunch of battle or destroyer droids and Neimoidians to flip.  
• Battle Droid Blaster Rifles are destiny 8 in the deck, and a big reason why the deck is good. They can be used to shoot characters, forfeited to use pile and re-deployed from Lost Pile plus they let You’ll Be Dead deal damage.  
• Tey How can reduce damage on Jakku drains, flip side is super annoying and the amount of recursion can keep Invasion in most damage races .

What Invasion does well against OA:  
• Vehicles can be shot down with the Rifles, or destroyer droids.  
• Tey How can cancel early Jakku drains.

What OA does well against Invasion:  
• Strong space, that can move to 2 systems. Home One can go to one, Falcon and Profundity to the other. Forcing Invasion to battle in space, which they don’t really like, because they have to commit too much to space.  
• Can potentially spread to several sites, which is also difficult for Invasion.  
• Lots of weapon protection is good against the rifles.

General strategy:  
• Flip, set up strong space.  
• Find evasion cards, battle in space, and spread on the ground while trying to avoid the weapons.  
• OA should, if played correctly, be slightly favored in the matchup.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Endor-Dark/large/endoroperations.gif">Endor Operations</a> (EOPS)</strong>  
• EOPS can be mains focused, space focused or a mix.  
• 3 effects and Any Methods Necessary starts are the two popular versions.  
• The objective pulls Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base v, so flipping is easy. The Bunker gets you Endor Shield v, and usually Establish Control v gives you Fondor and extra activation for docking bays. Generally pulls most important cards, but can also put a lot of cards on table.

What EOPS does well against OA:  
• Can put early pressure with a turn 1 Slave 1, Boba and Admiral Ozzel.  
• Limits you to one battle destiny in all battles when flipped, which is bad for Ackbar v, Poe and your Rebel Leaderships v.

What OA does well against EOPS:  
• EOPS will have to set up on Endor in order to flip, meaning they will have less cards to interact with you on Jakku.  
• 7 side negates bonus from Ominous Rumors.  
• If and when opponent moves away from the Bunker, you can flip them back, giving OA an edge thanks to multiple battle destinies .

General strategy:  
• Slave 1 to Jakku will set your flip back one turn, but that also means they have fewer cards in hand, making it slightly more safe to flip. You will need Profundity and Falcon at Jakku to flip.  
• Home One package will be needed mid game as EOPS can be strong in space..  
• Weapons protection and Leaderships are key cards. Barrier is very good to keep control part alive.  
• EOPS has less tricks than CCT or Senate, and has less ways of finding the tricks, so once you are set up you should be favored.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/mylordisthatlegal.gif">My Lord, Is That Legal?</a> (Senate)</strong>  
• Typically a 12-card start, with 8-10 senators, a few Squabbling Delegates and Senate Hovercam to set up at the Senate and flip.  
• Plays a heavy space package and a ground package which usually consists of EPP Characters.  
• Rarely plays Political Effects these days, but rather uses the text of the good senators.

What Senate does well against OA:  
• Can easily set up a strong space with Emperor in shuttle, Dengar in Punishing One and Conquest v.  
• Attrition bonus and other senators game text is very powerful.

What OA does well against Senate:  
• If OA can survive onslaughts in space, you can flip and spread on the ground.  
• The ground package in senate is less annoying for OA, so you should be able to survive easier there.  
• While senate can be very powerful in space, so can OA. Multiple battle destinies, Rey adding to total, Wedge cancelling one and Padmé adding to attrition can clear much of senates space.

General strategy:  
• If senate flips turn 1, they can quickly set up Emperor’s shuttle so be prepared for it when you try to flip.  
• The game will generally be decided in space, so your focus should be there.  
• Yoda Stew combo to cancel attrition, Barrier, Leadership v (watch out for Conquest v though) and characters like Ackbar, Rey, Padmé and Wedge are key cards.  
• Senate is a very difficult matchup and it all depends on surviving in space. Evacuation Control v is a good counter card.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Dark/large/thisdealisgettingworseallthetime.gif">This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time</a> (Deal)</strong>  
• Uses the objective to set up Dark Deal on Cloud City.  
• Free Executor (This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time) controls Bespin, while Walkers take over the sites.  
• Can also be played without Deal, not flipping, and just Cloud City Occupation for damage.

What Deal does well against OA:  
• Executor is very difficult to touch. It is also difficult to contest any walkers on the Cloud City sites. At least early on.  
• If deal foregoes their general game plan (setting up on Bespin) they can be quite strong when battling on Jakku sites thanks to General Veers v, Trample and similar cards. .

What OA does well against Deal:  
• Negates damage from Occupation.  
• Can eventually set up a stronger space, as OA generally runs 1 more big ship.  
• Can win the grindy matches thanks to retrieval from Leia and tons of damage mitigation.

General strategy:  
• While Deal sets up on Bespin, you should make sure you flip.  
• Find protection from Trample (They’re Tracking Us v, Perimeter Scan v), set up Wedge and another pilot in a speeder. Get Home One and Profundity to join Falcon in space. This takes a little time to do, and might cost you a few Force to drains in the meantime.  
• It’s a pretty even matchup.

<strong class="text-strong">Hoth CRv</strong>  
• Uses walkers on Hoth to deal damage with You May Start Your Landing, and satisfy Imperial Decree.  
• Can also run a pretty heavy space package, using Combat Response.

What Hoth CRv does well against OA:  
• The Hoth sites are difficult to contest.  
• Hoth CRv can also focus most of its forces on Jakku, making life difficult for LS. Image of the Dark Lord v, a walker with General Veers v along with Vader, Tarkin, Maul, can make it difficult to control two Jakku sites.

What OA does well against Hoth CRv:  
• Reduces YMSYL damage.  
• Much stronger in space, especially if Hoth CRv goes all in on the Jakku sites. Space drains and It’s A Hit! will give OA the advantage.

General strategy:  
• Set up in space, potentially you can go to both Jakku and Hoth. This can force DS to use Maul in ship to have a chance of satisfying Battle Plan (which will cost 2 Force a turn).  
• Try to avoid battles that are not on your terms. For example, don’t battle General Veers v in a walker, unless you are certain you can get enough attrition to clear something.  
• Trample protection, Rebel Leadership v, Barrier and speeders are key cards. Bacta Tank can be huge, to loop Jyn Erso.  
• OA is definitely favored and you can run more anti-vehicle cards if you are worried.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/nomoneynopartsnodeal.gif">No Money, No Parts, No Deal!</a> (Watto)</strong>  
• Watto is an interesting deck, that puts a lot of pressure on LS from Turn 1. Watto to Watto’s Junkyard and any card with ability to Mos Espa means 2 damage every turn.  
• First Order version is the current iteration, and relies heavily on Trooper Assault and trooper beats.  
• Broken Concentration and R’tic steals tons of force from LS.

What Watto does well against OA:  
• A lot of early pressure. Watto will do Watto damage for 2 or 3 turns before OA can set up. Strategic Reserves v is important to cancel drains.  
• The fear of beatdowns with troopers is huge.

What OA does well against Watto:  
• OA is strong in space, meaning you can get early drains going at Jakku.  
• OA can stack a considerable force at the 2/2 site, while Watto sets up on Tatooine, so OA will threaten drains of 2 and 2.  
• Looping key interrupts with Threepio and Rey make it difficult for Watto to grab the right card.

General strategy:  
• Watto will set up on Tatooine, so you should be able to flip early.  
• Consolidate on Jakku and the 2/2 site.  
• Alter for Strategic v and Broken, It’s A Hit! for Elis, It Could Be Worse and We’re Doomed for late game are the key cards.  
• Watto is slightly favored in the matchup, so you need to play careful and not leave characters alone.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/carbonchambertesting.gif">Carbon Chamber Testing</a> (CCT)</strong>  
• CCT is either a 12-card deck or starts Any Methods Necessary to guarantee IG-88v in your opening hand. 12-card is currently the more popular version.  
• CCT thrives on battling .  
• IG-88v finds all the needed tricks for every specific matchup.

What CCT does well against OA:  
• Can battle all over the Jakku sites with high power and multiple battle destinies. If CCT gets a good start, they can battle you early on Jakku with Emperor’s Shuttle, Emperor and Tarkin.  
• The threat of Carbon-Freezing is real. Even if they never freeze, you can’t reduce any other damage in their control phase.

What OA does well against CCT:  
• The 7 side is the best counter to Carbon-Freezing in the meta. .  
• If Emperor’s shuttle isn’t deployed early, OA has a much better space package.  
• As with many mains decks, speeders are difficult to deal with.

General strategy:  
• If CCT goes for an early Carbon Freeze attempt, make sure you flip right away, since there is no way you will win after losing 8 cards.  
• Otherwise, you will need Barrier to protect you in space, Leadership for the ground if you want to flip early.  
• Barrier, Leadership, It’s A Hit! Alter and Control & Tunnel Vision are key cards. Alter/Control are important to make sure your other important interrupts aren’t canceled by Sense.  
• CCT will attack you heavily on the ground, so you should stay strong on one site, and control Jakku system. That should give OA a slight advantage in the matchup, especially if your speeders survive.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/huntdownanddestroythejedi.gif">Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi</a> (HD)</strong>  
• HD is an aggressive mains deck, with lots of Dark Jedi.  
• It thrives on dealing fast damage, with Visage of The Emperor and early drain pressure on sites.  
• Runs heavy ground package, twixes and a smaller token space package (if any at all).

What HD does well against OA:  
• HD with high destinies can be annoying if HD sets up fast.  
• IF Rey is killed, HD will deal tons of damage. Also, Leia and Anakin are rather useless against HD when it’s flipped.

What OA does well against HD:  
• Negate Visage damage thanks to the objective.  
• Much stronger space allows OA to control Jakku rather easily.  
• Speeders are very difficult to deal with for HD.

General strategy:  
• Get Rey on a site (preferably on the Falcon). Flip using Profundity.  
• Set up with speeders, find weapons protection so P-59 and his friends won’t kill the speeders.  
• Watch out for multiple battle destinies from Grand Moff Tarkin v or Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter.  
• HD is a favorable matchup, but not an auto-win. Find damage reduction, set up safely in space and on ground, don’t waste characters (like deploying Anakin to a ship when HD is flipped) and play careful.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/DeathStarII-Dark/large/bringhimbeforeme.gif">Bring Him Before Me</a> (BHBM)</strong>  
• Puts Emperor at the Death Star II: Throne Room along with Emperor’s Power to add battle destiny in all battles.  
• Plays heavy mains, like Dark Jedi, that can draw a battle destiny on their own. Usually accompanied by a token space package like Zuckuss and Elis.  
• either 12-card or AMN 4-LOMv start.

What BHBM does well against OA:  
• OA can’t really prevent BHBM from dueling Luke, dealing 3 damage every second turn on average.  
• Can get 2 battle destinies from turn 2 in any battle, so you will have to be careful before you are set up.

What OA does well against BHBM:  
• Stronger space.  
• Can’t play Luke, so can’t lose him either. New shield makes this less of an advantage. But BHBM losing Vader gives them one less character to battle with.  
• Vehicles are difficult for BHBM to kill.

General strategy:  
• If you have a Leadership v, you can keep Falcon on the ground turn 1. If you have a Barrier, you can probably fly up to threaten a drain of 2. Flip when safe, don’t be hasty.  
• Stronger space again. Home One is very difficult for BHBM to clear.  
• As usual, Barrier, Leadership, Keep Your Eyes Open v are key cards. It Could Be Worse can be huge late game against dueling.  
• OA is favored. Watch out for the 3 damage from dueling.

<strong class="text-strong">Other mains builds, Coruscant CRv or Court</strong>  
• Court Mains, Coruscant CRv and similar mains builds are slightly different from HD or BHBM mains. Usually they have different activation packages, and can run a more streamlined space package.  
• Combat Response v, I Am Your Father v are common starting effects.

What Mains does well against OA:  
• Early pressure. Decks with Combat Response v can go to Jakku turn 1.  
• Guaranteed better activation (especially Coruscant CRv) makes it harder to flip early as DS can afford to deploy more cards early on.

What OA does well against Mains:  
• Just like against HD or BHBM, OA can be stronger in space.  
• If the speeders survive, they are a big reason for OA coming out on top.

General strategy:  
• Falcon will have to go space. Speeders to protect from weapons on the ground.  
• Set up a strong space. Unlike against HD, you will need all ships.  
• Weapons protection, Alter, Rebel Barrier and Leadership v are likely key cards. It’s A Hit! can be important too.  
• Many things are similar to BHBM and HD matchups, not everything though, so keep an eye out for different tricks, like Lateral Damage.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/EnhancedJabbasPalace-Dark/large/courtofthevilegangster.gif">Court Of The Vile Gangster</a> (Court)</strong>  
• Court Scum plays a bunch of different aliens, with the help of Scum & Villainy.  
• Court pulls it activation with objective and Jabba’s Haven, gets its starships from the objective AND does damage if LS can’t go to Tatooine early .  
• Court can play reactive, aggressive and defensive with tons of aliens, Hidden Weapons, Stunning Leader, and bounty hunters.

What Court does well against OA:  
• Early pressure, Audience Chamber can be uncontested for entire games.  
• Easily sets up in space, and can use its entire deck to battle on Jakku.  
• Broken Concentration can be very powerful.

What OA does well against Court:  
• Once OA sets up, and plays defensively, it can negate a lot of Courts early set up.  
• Space is very strong, Home One and Profundity have a lot more power than Elis/Zuckuss with a bunch of passengers, so even if Court can get a bunch of attrition, OA should win power wise. Pulling Profundity also prevents Court from going early to Jakku system.  
• Hiding in speeders protects from Hidden Weapons, IG-88 and similar cards.  
• Key cards to find are Rebel Barrier, Rebel Leadership v and the speeders. If you run multiple Harc Seff v, he can make a big difference early on.

General strategy:  
• Flip once it is safe. Usually with Falcon and Profundity at Jakku, and a consolidate force on one site.  
• Find key cards, set up a strong space, where DS has to run away so you can drain +1 with Launching the Assault.  
• Run away if necessary on the ground, but speeders and Rebel Leadership v can help battling.  
• If possible, set up on the Pit of Carkoon and cancel Scum with Alter. The Scum retrieval is one of the main things that can let Court win the match.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/ReflectionsII-Dark/large/agentsofblacksun.gif">Agents Of Black Sun</a> (AOBS)</strong>  
• Emperor and a mix of Black Sun agents deal ping damage, manipulate decks and add attrition.  
• Popular versions are AMN start for 4-LOM v, or 12-card hand. AOBS rarely needs 3 effects.

What AOBS does well against OA:  
• Tricks like Hidden Weapons, Program Trap, multiple battle destinies can cause troubles on Jakku sites.  
• If Rey is removed from the table, it can quickly turn for the worse.

What OA does well against AOBS:  
• Rey, already a central character for the deck, will keep AOBS on the 0-side as long as she stays on the ground.  
• Stronger space, loads of interrupts that are good against the tricks AOBS rely on.  
• 7 side can deal with the damage, and the destiny reduction is good against tricks like Hidden Weapons.

General strategy:  
• Falcon should stay on the ground early on, leaving Profundity as the go to solution for flipping.  
• Find a speeder, and you can hold/contest 2 sites with Falcon and the speeder. Try to keep Home One in hand in case AOBS try to set up on Coruscant system.  
• They’re Tracking Us v, Barriers, Home One Package and Leadership v are key cards.  
• OA is definitely favored in the matchup, as AOBS can have a hard time without Program Trap being a reliable weapon.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/plugins/card-search/cards/starwars/Virtual8-Dark/large/iwantthatmap.gif">I Want That Map</a> (MAP)</strong>  
• Starting interrupt gives MAP a chance to flip turn 1 with Kylo and his shuttle, maximizing the potential on the 7 side right away.  
• Plays Bow with Kylo, Hux and Phasma followed by tons of troopers, trooper assaults, and Finalizer.

What MAP does well against OA:  
• Map can usually flip turn 1, which is bad for OA. They threaten 5 damage turn 2.  
• Separates Niima Outpost Shipyard from Rey’s Encampment, forcing LS to move an extra turn to get Rey to the Falcon.  
• Can, with a good hand, battle anything LS deploy turn 1, on their turn 2.

What OA does well against MAP:  
• Stronger space in the long run.  
• Can find their Resistance Agent quite easily.  
• General Leia Organa is huge mid and late game, retrieving 2 when initiating a battle.

General strategy:  
• Your starting hand decides what to do early on. Jyn and Control are good cards to slow down Map. Rey in starting hand is also good, as she can then deploy directly to Falcon.  
• Try and go all in early on to space. Get Profundity, Ackbar v, Home one and Falcon to Jakku as soon as you can.  
• Control, Jyn, space package and Leadership are important. It’s A Hit! to prevent the Elis drop on you,.  
• Worst matchup in the meta for OA. Winnable, but you need to do everything right and find key cards early.

Meta check (set 8)

OA is potentially good in any meta, but definitely took a hit with the introduction of MAP.

OA also took a hit with the Harc Seff v errata, making it a slightly slower deck.

That being said, there is a lot of room for counter cards in the deck, and it can be played slightly differently with either a 3 effect or 12-card start, so there is lots of room for improvement and meta adjustments.
