The Star Wars CCG Committee have been working on a new website for some time now. We are finally ready to make it publicly viewable. We know people are hesitant to change and with all transitions there are bound to be some pains. We ask you to please stay patient.

There are still some sections of the site that are still under development like About the PC, Player Locator and Game Formats to name a few. We will be adding content to those areas in the coming days/weeks.

If you happen to find any bugs in the site, missing files, or other oddities, please [contact us](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/contact/ "Contact Us") and let us know what the issue is. We will be working to get any issues cleared up as soon as possible.

The forums which are user the heaviest by the community had no down time in the transition from the old site to the new site and there are no foreseeable issues regarding that either. We still need to move the user database over to the new site which will take a little bit of time to allow chat room usage. Until that time, please bare with us.
