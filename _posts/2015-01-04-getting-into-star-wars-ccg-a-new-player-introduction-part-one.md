So, you’ve just finished watching the video footage of those terrible Rebels blowing up yet another Death Star, and you’re wondering, what can I do to help out the Galactic Empire? Well, while the reports of Emperor Palpatine&#8217;s and Lord Vader’s demises are still unconfirmed rumors at this point, you can still help engage some Rebel scum as they celebrate on the forest moon of Endor – and maybe even take a few of those Ewoks with them.

## Here’s how: play Star Wars CCG.

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7021 size-height195" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Recruitment-443x192.jpg" alt="Recruitment" width="443" height="192" />](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Recruitment.jpg)

Like Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Lord of the Rings, or any other card game, the Star Wars Customizable Card allows its players to do battle over their table tops against their opponent using decks of cards that they selected themselves. Imagine playing poker, but instead of the standard 52 cards, you got to decide to play only Aces and Kings? And now think of that scenario, but instead of Aces and Kings, you get to play with Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.

This article series is meant as an introduction into Star Wars CCG for the new player.  This first part is just a general overview of _why_ it is worth your time to think about enrolling into the Imperial Navy and getting into this card game.  After reading this, it is recommended that you look at some of the other various articles on this website (or even some videos on youtube, just type in Star Wars CCG or SW CCG) as far as the general mechanics and the rules of the game, for a better grasp.

Additionally, follow up articles in this series will be released with tips on how to quickly (and inexpensively!) enter the game and be ready to play. _Part Two_ will include some of the general cards that you should look to stock up on, without becoming overwhelmed with cards you may not need right away.  It will hopefully provide useful tips on getting the cards you need so that you can start chopping Sith Lords in half right away. It will also contain some links to helpful resources for newer players, all in one convenient spot.

_Part Three_ will pick out some of the more iconic scenes and events from the Star Wars movies and identify the cards you’d need to recreate those scenes and build powerful decks based upon them – focusing on doing it on a budget.  However, while we should be mindful of the future, it should not be at the expense of the moment. So for now, let’s focus on why you should pick up the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.

## So, you want to play a card game…

The trading card game industry has been around for some time now and most games have come and gone.  While it is indisputable that Magic: The Gathering has far and away been the juggernaut of trading card games, there was a time not too long ago (in a galaxy very, very near you…) where Decipher’s Star Wars: Customizable Card Game was the second most popular card game.  Players used their cards to build Dark Side decks that blew up planets with the Death Star and Light Side decks that blew up the Death Star; they could build Dark Side decks that tested the carbon freezing process on Captain Solo (you know, to make sure you didn’t damage the Emperor’s Prize…) and Light Side decks to infiltrate Jabba’s Palace to rescue Han from that carbon freezing process; in fact, they could build their decks to recreate every imaginable scenario within the Star Wars universe, from Jawas selling droids to a few middle class moisture farmers to the son of the chosen one trying to convert his father back to the Light Side.

Well, the legacy of those films (and that card game) continue to thrive today.  While Decipher, Inc., the company that produced and printed the Star Wars CCG no longer prints physical cards, the game continues with a very active playing community.

## How does the game work (the abbreviated version)

The premise of the game is a very interactive, two-player competition over control of the galaxy, with one player battling as the Dark Side of the Force, using all of the bad guys (from Vader, to Boba Fett, to Jabba the Hutt and even the Emperor himself) and the other playing using cards from the Light Side of the Force (with the good guys, Luke, Han, Ben and even a pesky droid or two…). Each player selects a few key locations or themes to feature in their deck, whether it be Junland Wastes on Tatooine, the Imperial Square on Coruscant, the Cave where Luke failed on Dagobah or even the Death Star itself.  After a player plays his locations, then it’s up to him and his opponent to fight over control of them; so choose wisely, as each location has its own drawbacks and benefits. For example, the Empire can get a huge leg up on the Rebellion if it uses the Death Star, however imagine how bad it would be for the Imperials if the Rebels were to somehow win control over that <span style="text-decoration: line-through">moon</span> space station.

The fights can take place on the ground (think of Han blasting stormtroopers) or in space (think of a star destroyer chasing Princess Leia’s ship) and they can be as simple as one side out powering another, or characters exchanging blaster fire or lightsaber swings. After any fights, the characters (or starships) who survive are free to move about the land looking to further their grip on the galaxy against their enemies or just stay put at the location that they are at. And, of course, as you get more and more into the game, you can extend your strategy beyond just fighting for board control, but can also try out certain objectives that give you other bonuses within the game (for example, the Rebels could try building a base on Dantooine or having Yoda train Luke to be a Jedi, while the Empire is out Vader to hunt down and destroy all of the Jedi or dabbling in Jabba’s kind of scum and villainy by going bounty hunting).

As you can see, the possibilities of the game are nearly endless – and they’re all Star Wars. It is a constantly changing environment, saturated with the characters, starships, weapons, places and lore that you love. In fact, the state of the game never gets stagnant as the Star Wars CCG Players Committee has taken over control of the game and has produced new cards ever since Decipher lost the ability to. Better yet – these cards are distributed for free! So while players of some other games are groaning over shelling out hundreds of dollars for booster boxes of the latest expansion to their card game, Star Wars CCG players just hit print on their keyboards, and new cards are instantly delivered, for free! New expansions are generally released by the Player’s Committee on a similar time frame as Decipher would release their expansions, so the transition is seamless.

## So, why should you play Star Wars CCG?

So you may be wondering, why should you give Star Wars CCG a try over some of the other card games out there? Well, first of all – it’s Star Wars! Magic: The Gathering doesn’t have the Force, Pokemon doesn’t have Yoda, Lord of the Rings doesn’t have lightsabers, and My Little Pony doesn’t have banthas. But Star Wars CCG does. It has almost everything you can imagine in the Star Wars universe. From Han Solo flying the _Millennium Falcon_ to do a Kessel Runs to that obscure little alien smoking his pipe in the Cantina scene from _A New Hope_.  Star Wars CCG offers the familiarity and comfort of that galaxy far, far away…

[<img class="  wp-image-7022 aligncenter" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/A_long_time_ago-300x169.png" alt="A_long_time_ago" width="325" height="183" />](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/A_long_time_ago.png)

Secondly, investing your time into a new hobby is already an important decision to make – there is little reason to also have to invest a great deal of money.  Many people (including former players of the game) thought that the game died when Decipher stopped producing cards – however, nothing could be further from the truth!  So while some players have dropped the game, this has greatly reduced the start up costs of playing Star Wars CCG. Look, hobbies cost money. We have to understand that and there’s no getting around that.  However, when compared to the price of other games, you can build a very, very competitive Star Wars CCG deck for pennies on the dollar. Entire collections can be had of former players for affordable prices and single cards can be purchases very cheaply from any number of online stores, including the Players Committee itself.  And, as mentioned above, there are no expensive expansions you have to keep up with – you simply print out the new cards on the Player’s Committee website for free! So, essentially, once you get your base of cards (which Part Two of this series will help you identify), there will be little to no maintenance costs associated with continuing to play the game like you would have from other card games. In fact, as some [other articles](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/play-star-wars-ccg-in-15-minutes-new-and-returning-players-article/) point out, you can even play the game online – for free!

Another great bonus of the game is that you do not need complicated or disorganized tokens or markers to play the game. You decks and a table top (or some floor space) are all you need to play the game. You draw resources from your own deck and your opponent tries to dwindle away those resources from your deck; once your deck is depleted, the game is over. It is as simple as that. So no longer do you need to worry about picking up those silly glass beads or if your life counter got adjusted last turn. All you need are your decks.

Finally, your timing to try Star Wars CCG could not be better! The Player’s Committee has decided to “re-set” the virtual card pool, meaning that everyone is essentially on equal footing and you won’t have to go through pages and pages of old cards in order to catch up on what you’ve missed. The game is at its most basic and at the point where many who left probably remember, so it really is an exciting time to pick up (or even get back into) Star Wars CCG.

In fact, this past November, the Player’s Committee hosted a Local Tournament Weekend and across the country, turnout was amazing – both returning players came back to check in on the game and new players took advantage of the opportunity to try out the game, essentially from the beginning of Virtual Cards.

So, please look around the official Star Wars CCG website. You’ll likely find answers to a lot of questions. A peek at the [Virtual Cards](http://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/virtual-slips/) will show you exactly how you can just print out new cards and put the slips up over old ones to create a whole new playing experience. Jumping over to the [message boards and forums](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/index.php) can also help answer a lot of questions, from [rules questions](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=5) to [general discussions](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=2) about improving player’s decks.  There’s even an entire [forum for newer players](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=332) to help catch them up to speed and help them learn and play the game. Be sure to browse around there – there’s lots of helpful information.  You can also find other players in your general area by searching the [Player Locator forum](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=348). Heck, even try to find a [League](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=659) (generally a regular meet up for locals to play on a certain &#8220;game night&#8221; or weekend) or [Tournament](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=494) near you. In fact, even if you have never played before, if you send a Private Message to the Tournament or League Director (by locating his post about the event and then near the bottom of that post clicking the “PM” button), I’m sure he would be glad to set you up either by explaining the game to you or having your shadow the tournament – maybe even let you borrow a deck to try it out.

That forum also has ways to contact other players who may be in your area as well as information on upcoming tournaments or events. So, once you get those power converters from the Tosche Station, go ahead take a look around the website. Register a username (for free) on the message boards and feel free to ask any questions you may have or even look for a playing community or someone to help you learn the game (or get cards to you!). You might even find that part to the Noobian ship you had to crash-land on the outskirts of Tatooine…
