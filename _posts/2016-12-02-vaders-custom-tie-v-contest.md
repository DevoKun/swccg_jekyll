Over the years, few cards have been requested to be virtualized more often than Vader’s Custom TIE. So many players and groups have asked for it that we ultimately decided that there was no fair way to give the design to a specific player (even as a main card). Vader’s Custom TIE has been reserved for a special occasion, and we have found such an occasion now &#8212; and one that includes the entire community as well.

We are giving you, the players, the opportunity to enter your proposed game text for Vader&#8217;s Custom TIE.  
**Simply PM your proposed game text to Shadow 14 no later than December 18th.**  
**You must include your full first and last name in the PM.** Limit of one entry per person. Your game text must fit within this template:

[Vader&#8217;s Custom TIE test text.doc](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Vaders-Custom-TIE-test-text.doc)

Please use this attached test text document to ensure you do not include too much game text. If you would like assistance or advice on the template or text, you may PM the Design Advocate, quickdraw3457 (Matt Carulli).

Design & Development will then choose 4 finalists from all of the entrants. On December 23rd, we will reveal these 4 finalists (the concept designers&#8217; names will not be included with the concepts), and the players will vote on the concept that will be developed and playtested for release. Voting will run from December 24th to January 5th, in which all players can choose which concept they prefer. The concept with the most votes will be deemed the winner, and will be revealed at the MPC in January. The player who submits the winning concept will have his name on Vader’s Custom TIE (V).

All concepts submitted must use the same stats and template. For the virtual Vader&#8217;s Custom TIE, we have already tweaked the stats and template to be as follows (your game text must include &#8220;May add 1 pilot.&#8221; or &#8220;May add Vader as pilot&#8221;):

Please be aware that the card is still treated as any other virtual card, and will have to be proofed, playtested, and possibly tweaked to make it work within the confines of our favorite game. Any changes made to the submitted concept are not subject to approval by the original designer, and will be approved by development. However, the spirit of the winning concept must be maintained throughout the process.

We have set the deadline for entering the game text as 18th December so that you will have time to watch the new Star Wars: Rogue One movie in theaters. It might be possible that the Custom TIE will make an appearance in the movie, so keep this in mind if you are looking for ideas.

Help the Dark Lord of the Sith so that he no longer has to be transported in a shuttle piloted by unworthy Imperials. The best starpilot in the galaxy should have his own set of wings, and you can contribute to making it a worthy card.
