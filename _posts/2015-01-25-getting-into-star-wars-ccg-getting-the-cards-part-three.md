### Those <del>Rebels</del> Cards Won&#8217;t Escape Us

So, you&#8217;ve decided to play and maybe you even have some cards in your collection. While many of your cards may never feel the warmth of snug-fitting deck protector, there are certain cards that serious and competitive players will want to have in their collections and always at their disposal &#8211; even if they are not needed for one of their current decks, these cards are generally useful, appear in common decks and players should generally be familiar with as they commonly see play (either in their deck or in their opponent&#8217;s decks).

While this is not an exhaustive list of every card you would ever need (nor is it a list of cards your MUST have), it does provide a good background of the cards players generally like to have on hand to engage in liberal deck building.

Also, a note about the list: the point of this list is to help newer players identify cards that they should be familiar with, both for game play reasons _and_ to help them build their collections. For that reason, the cards are categorized by card type and then alphabetized based upon the actual card needed to play (not necessarily based upon the card type or card title after Virtualization). Additionally, in order to assist players who may be looking to obtain the card(s), the expansion sets for the physical card is also listed. However, where the card is being included on this list due to the strength or popularity of its &#8220;virtualized&#8221; version, the Virtual Set release may also be listed, so that players know to check out that game text. In the event that the Virtual Card changes the title of the card, the title of the Virtual Card (and Virtual Set it is from) is placed in {brackets} to indicate that even though the physical card needed may be one title, the actual, playable card to be on the look out for is something entirely different.

Also, this list will be updated periodically, both as new Virtual Sets and the &#8220;meta&#8221; dictate that cards be included or removed, and (as time allows) for a listing at the end of the cards needed to re-enact certain scenes or themes from the movies on your table tops.

Finally, much thanks, credit and gratitude to [MAVanDriel](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=173), who contributed immensely, both publicly on the forums and privately with the author, to the creation of this list. His initial thread, and commentary and discussion, can be found [here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=332&t=51974).

### **Starting Effects and Defensive Shields **

Defensive Shields are the Star Wars CCG-equivalent of a &#8220;sideboard.&#8221; They are cards from outside your main deck that can help you against certain types of strategies. Since the Defensive Shields under your Starting Effect do not take up any &#8220;deck slots&#8221; in your 60 card decks and can be very powerful counters or answers to your opponent&#8217;s deck, they are all but necessary in the modern tournament environment.  Because of this, it essentially goes without saying that players will want the Starting Effect cards and a complete set of Defensive Shields in their collections, so they are not included within the main lists; however, you may click on the menu below if you wish to see the complete list of Defensive Shields for each side.

[wc_toggle title=&#8221;Defensive Shields&#8221; layout=&#8221;box&#8221;]

Decipher released all of their Defensive Shields in the Reflections III expansion (18 for the Dark Side and 16 for the Light Side). Many of those original Defensive Shields were based off of Effect cards that had already existed in the game, except these newer versions would not could against your deck size limit. In an effort to make these powerful cards more available to its player base, the Player&#8217;s Committee has released a [Virtual Set of Defensive Shields](http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Shields-Decipher.pdf) that allows players to use those original Effects as their Defensive Shield counterparts. Accordingly, in each of the respective lists below, for those cards that list Reflections III and an alternative expansion set (e.g. Allegations of Corruption lists both Reflections III and Coruscant expansions), players may look to obtain either version of the card; if they have the Effect version from the secondary expansion, just print out the Defensive Shield Virtual Set and use the slip for that card to make it function identically to the Defensive Shield from Reflections III.

Additionally, the Players Committee has also released new Defensive Shields (both creating completely new cards and virtualizing existing Defensive Shields to improve them). The lists below are the actual physical cards you will need to have a complete set of Defensive Shields, including any virtualizations.

### Specific Cards for Decks

While the above list would give you a great base of cards, if you are looking to play out certain scenes or themes from the movies, you should focus on some of the below cards, which may be easier to start your collection and provide you with a cohesive, thematic deck.

_Note: more themes will be added over time as time allows, likely in movie order, so please check back if you&#8217;re waiting on a particular theme. _

[wc_toggle title=&#8221;Episode I &#8211; The Phantom Menace themes&#8221; layout=&#8221;box&#8221;]

### DARK SIDE

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Trade Federation&#8217;s blockade and invasion of Naboo</span>  
_This deck focuses on using battle droids and Neimoidians to take over the Naboo: Theed Palace Throne Room._  
You will want the objective card, [Invasion](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/invasion.gif) / [In Complete Control](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/incompletecontrol.gif) (Theed Palace) and the cards that it deploys at the start of the game: the [Naboo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/naboo.gif) system (Coruscant), the [Blockade Flagship](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/blockadeflagship.gif) starship (Theed Palace), [Naboo: Swamp](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/nabooswamp.gif) (Coruscant), and the effect [Droid Racks](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/droidracks.gif) (Theed Palace). This set up gives you a starship at Naboo, a site to go to, and an effect that lets you recycle your droids. From there, you will want some Naboo sites (especially the [Naboo: Theed Palace Throne Room](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/nabootheedpalacethroneroom.gif) from Coruscant, however there are also other Naboo sites you will want from the Coruscant and maybe even Reflections III expansions). You will also want to fill your deck with battle droids &#8211; look over the [Coruscant](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/CoruscantType.html) and [Theed Palace](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/TheedType.html) expansion lists for all of the various Battle Droids  
The only other characters with ability you can use are those with &#8220;Trade Federation&#8221; in their lore, which includes [Darth Sidious](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/darthsidious.gif) (Theed Palace), Lord Maul (Reflections III), Count Dooku (Dark Maneuvers from Premiere, using the Virtual Slip from Virtual Set 0), and the Neimoidians ([Rune Haako, Legal Counsel](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/runehaakolegalcounsel.gif) and [Nute Gunray, Neimoidian Viceroy](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/nutegunrayneimoidianviceroy.gif) seem to be made for the ground &#8211; you will need them in multiples &#8211; and [Captain Daultay Dofine](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/captaindaultaydofine.gif) seems to be the perfect pilot for the Blockade Flagship to deploy at the start of game, backed up by [Sil Unch](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/silunch.gif)). And don&#8217;t forget the destiny 6 gun &#8211; [Battle Droid Blaster Rifle](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/battledroidblasterrifle.gif) &#8211; in multiples.  
Your space selection is also limited to Trade Federation starships, of which the Coruscant and Theed Palace expansions have several. You may also use [Maul&#8217;s Sith Infiltrator](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/maulssithinfiltrator.gif), the [Trade Federation Droid Control Ship](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/tradefederationdroidcontrolship.gif) (and also it&#8217;s Virtual version, the Blockade Support Ship from Virtual Set 0), Guri (Reflections II) in the Stinger (Reflections II) from Virtual Set 0, or [IG-88 In IG-2000](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedJabbasPalace-Dark/large/ig88inig2000.gif).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maul searching Tatooine for the Queen</span>  
_Although it is not extraordinarily powerful, it does make for a nice side-theme of a deck to have Maul and force the opponent to play Amidala. These cards are all from the Tatooine expansion._  
By starting the [Tatooine: Desert Landing Site](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/tatooinedesertlandingsite.gif), and using [I Will Find Them Quickly, Master](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/iwillfindthemquicklymaster.gif), you will get access to the Epic Event [If The Trace Was Correct](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/ifthetracewascorrect.gif), which allows for some global bonuses when Maul has accomplished what Sidious sent him out to do and captured the Queen. [Sith Probe Droid](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/sithprobedroid.gif) is another good card for the deck, both in its regular version (from Tatooine) and its virtual version (from Virtual Set 0). Obviously you will want to play multiple versions of a Darth Maul persona. Also note that you can pair this strategy with other themes, such as the Senate theme below, or by using the Combat Readiness (V) (physical card from Endor, slip from Virtual Set 0) to start the Desert Landing Site and the Tatooine system.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Watto negotiating with Qui-Gon for ship parts (and Anakin)</span>  
_This deck focuses on using Watto at his Junkyard to force the opponent to pay for things &#8211; and if he doesn&#8217;t like your price, he has to deal with the consequences of not getting the parts he needs. The cards you need to set the deck up are mostly from the Tatooine and Coruscant expansions, however it is a very open-ended platform and there are no restrictions on which characters you must &#8211; or cannot &#8211; play, other than needing Watto._  
The deck is based on the objective card, [No Money, No Parts, No Deal!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/nomoneynopartsnodeal.gif) /[You&#8217;re A Slave?](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/youreaslave.gif) (Coruscant), which deploys [Tatooine: Watto&#8217;s Junkyard](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/tatooinewattosjunkyard.gif) (Coruscant) and [Tatooine: Mos Espa](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/tatooinemosespa.gif) (Tatooine). From there you will want [Watto](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/watto.gif) (Tatooine) x 3 or so and then your options are wide open. You simply need Watto at his Junkyard and then any other character at Mos Espa to use your objective, so one good strategy is to start the Endor Shield (V) (physical card from Death Star II, virtual slip from Virtual Set 1) to get [Admiral Ozzel](Admiral%20Ozzel) (Hoth), who deploys for 0 Force, to guarantee a first turn flip &#8211; which means you can put any card down with the 7-side of the objective to make the Light Side lose 2 Force before they even had a turn. From there, you move Ozzel over to the Junkyward with Watto (where the opponent cannot draw battle destiny) and then continue on your next turns to deploy a character to Mos Espa, cause damage to the opponent or deploy your expensive cards for free with the 7-side of the objective. The platform is very wide open. Another option is to start the Kuat Drive Yards (V) effect (physical card from Special Edition, slip from Virtual Set 0) and use it to deploy the Tatooine system (either from Premiere or Coruscant) and then set up [Tatooine Occupation](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/tatooineoccupation.gif) to cause more damage.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Podracing</span>  
_This is a side-theme that can play with any objective since it only requires a starting interrupt to play. The cards needed for this strategy are all from the Tatooine expansion._  
You use the Starting Interrupt: [Start Your Engines!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/startyourengines.gif), which deploys everything you need: [Tatooine: Podrace Arena](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/tatooinepodracearena.gif), any podracer ([Sebulba&#8217;s Podracer](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/sebulbaspodracer.gif) is the best), and the Epic Event [Boonta Eve Podrace](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/boontaevepodrace.gif). If you really want to get heavily into the theme (which is not extraordinarily powerful given all of the counter-cards to it), check out [Watto&#8217;s Box](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/wattosbox.gif) (Tatooine) or [Gardulla The Hutt](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/gardullathehutt.gif) (Coruscant).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The conflict in the Galactic Senate</span>  
_This deck shows how manipulative the Dark Side can be over the galaxy by controlling the Senate. The cards you will absolutely need for this deck are from the Coruscant expansion, except for the Senate Hovercam._  
You start with the Senate objective: [My Lord, Is That Legal?](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/mylordisthatlegal.gif) / [I Will Make It Legal](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/iwillmakeitlegal.gif), the [Coruscant: Galactic Senate](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/coruscantgalacticsenate.gif) site and any Episode 1 location ([Blockade Flagship: Bridge](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/blockadeflagshipbridge.gif) from Coruscant, [Naboo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/naboo.gif) from Coruscant, or [Tatooine: Desert Landing Site](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/tatooinedesertlandingsite.gif) from Tatooine are all good choices, depending on what you&#8217;d like your deck to do. After that you will want the senators and politicians in multiples.  The best one is [Lott Dod](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/lottdod.gif), followed by [Aks Moe](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/aksmoe.gif), [Baskol Yeesrim](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/baskolyeesrim.gif), [Edcel Bar Gane](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/edcelbargane.gif), [Orn Free Taa](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/ornfreetaa.gif), [Passel Argente](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/passelargente.gif), [Tikkes](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/tikkes.gif), [Toonbuck Toora](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/toonbucktoora.gif), and [Yeb Yeb Adem&#8217;thorn](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/yebyebademthorn.gif). Then you will use all four of the Political Effects that help you manipulate the galaxy: [Accepting Trade Federation Control](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/acceptingtradefederationcontrol.gif),  [Motion Supported](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/motionsupported.gif), [Our Blockade Is Perfectly Legal](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/ourblockadeisperfectlylegal.gif), and [This Is Outrageous!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/thisisoutrageous.gif). Finally, the only other card you will &#8220;need&#8221; is [Senate Hovercam](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/senatehovercam.gif) (from the Theed Palace expansion). From there you have a very open ended platform to destroy the opponent with.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The final lightsaber duel between Maul and the Jedi</span>  
_Everyone loves the final scene, with &#8220;Duel of the Fates&#8221; blasting as Maul takes on Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. This deck uses your Dark Jedi to control Naboo locations and force the opponent&#8217;s Jedi to come to you, where you lightsaber combat them. The cards you need for this deck are all from the Reflections III expansion._  
You will need the objective card [Let Them Make The First Move](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/letthemmakethefirstmove.gif) / [At Last We Will Have Revenge](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/atlastwewillhaverevenge.gif) and the cards it deploys: [Naboo: Theed Palace Generator](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/nabootheedpalacegenerator.gif), [Naboo: Theed Palace Generator Core](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/nabootheedpalacegeneratorcore.gif), and [Deep Hatred](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/deephatred.gif). From there, you will want plenty of Dark Jedi to lightsaber combat with ([Lord Maul](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/lordmaul.gif) with [Maul&#8217;s Double-Bladed Lightsaber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/maulsdoublebladedlightsaber.gif) was literally designed for this, however you will also need support Dark Jedi such as Vader personas, Count Dooku (Dark Maneuvers from Premiere, using the Virtual Slip from Virtual Set 0), and even [Darth Sidious](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Dark/large/darthsidious.gif) (Theed Palace), who can place Jedi out of play if he wins lightsaber combat and he&#8217;s alone). Other good cards for the theme include  [Qui-Gon&#8217;s End](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/quigonsend.gif), [Maul Strikes](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/maulstrikes.gif), and [The Ebb Of Battle](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/theebbofbattle.gif). Battle evasion cards (since you cannot initiate battle and want to keep your Dark Jedi and their Jedi on table together during your move phase) are also good, including [Imperial Barrier](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Dark/large/imperialbarrier.gif) (Premiere) and [Stunning Leader](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Dark/large/stunningleader.gif) (A New Hope). Many people start Blaster Rack (V) as an effect (physical card from Premiere, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0) to get lightsabers out quickly. High destiny is the name of the game, so support cards like [The Phantom Menace](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/thephantommenace.gif) (Coruscant) or Image of the Dark Lord (V) (physical card from Hoth, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0) are also helpful. A word on [Emperor Palpatine](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Dark/large/emperorpalpatine.gif) (Death Star II): he&#8217;s nice in the deck because he&#8217;s both a Dark Jedi and a destiny 6, however he is very expensive and cannot actually move over to lightsaber combat Jedi that are not at his site, so he is not particularly necessary for the deck if your funds fall short.

### LIGHT SIDE

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The heroes trying to get from Tatooine back to Coruscant</span>  
_After escaping the blockade from Naboo, the Jedi and have to crash land on Tatooine and deal with a junkyard dealer to get the parts needed to fix their ship._  
You will need the objective card, [The Hyperdrive Generator&#8217;s Gone](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/thehyperdrivegeneratorsgone.gif) / [We&#8217;ll Need A New One](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/wellneedanewone.gif) (Coruscant exansion), which deploys [Tatooine: Watto&#8217;s Junkyard](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/tatooinewattosjunkyard.gif) (Coruscant expansion), [Tatooine: City Outskirts](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/tatooinecityoutskirts.gif) (Tatooine expansion) and the effect, [Credits Will Do Fine](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/creditswilldofine.gif) (Coruscant expansion). These locations let you deploy a Jedi from your Reserve Deck and go to Watto&#8217;s Junkyard, where you simulate negotiating over a price for the parts you need for your starship. This is done through the effect Credits Will Do Fine, which essentially causes the opponent to lose Force when you do favorable things (like Force drain or win battles) at the Junkyard.  Once you have beaten Watto&#8217;s will down, he&#8217;ll sell you the parts, and you flip your objective, giving you several bonuses, including letting you retrieve Force whenever you draw battle destiny. The deck essentially prevents you from using the Rebels, so characters you will want to focus on would be Qui-Gon Jinn (Tatooine expansion) or Master Qui-Gon (V) (physical card from Coruscant, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0) and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padawan Learner (V) (physical card from Tatooine expansion, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0). Other good characters to use would be Padme Naberrie (from Tatooine expansion), who lets you deploy Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan from your Reserve Deck and Mace Windu (V) (physical card from Coruscant expansion, virtual slip from Virtual Set 1). A persona of Captain Panaka (either from Coruscant or Theed Palace) would also be good, as he can shoot characters or vehicles that are trying to fight you at the Junkyard with his gun, Panaka&#8217;s Blaster (Coruscant expansion). And, of course, especially with all of the Jedi, you will want their ligthsaber cards too (meaning, you may want to start Sai&#8217;torr Kal Fas (V) (Premiere expansion, Virtual Set 0) as one of your effects, since that lets you deploy weapons from your Reserve Deck. This deck usually focuses on fighting on the ground, and does not feature many space cards.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Podracing</span>  
Like the Dark Side strategy above, podracing can be used as a side-strategy since it only requires a few cards (and all of them are from the Tatooine expansion), all of which are startable with the Starting Interrupt, [Podrace Prep](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/podraceprep.gif), which deploys [Tatooine: Podrace Arena](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/tatooinepodracearena.gif), [Anakin&#8217;s Podracer](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/anakinspodracer.gif) (which pulls the powerful Epic Event, [I Did It!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/ididit.gif)), and [Boonta Eve Podrace](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/boontaevepodrace.gif). With those cards, when you win the podrace, you set yourself up to cause damage to the opponent and retrieve Force yourself. Of course, even if the opponent has a way around the effects of losing the podrace, you still have I Did It!, which allows you to retrieve even more Force and cause the opponent to use all of his additional Force at the end of his turns.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Galactic Senate</span>  
_Queen Amidala accompanies Senator Palpatine to plead her case to the Senate._  
Like the Dark Side deck above, this deck uses the Light Side Senators to control the Galactic Senate and manipulate the rest of the game through the use of various Political Effects. The cards you will need for this deck are almost exclusively from the Coruscant expansion.  Specifically, you will need the objective, [Plead My Case To The Senate](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/pleadmycasetothesenate.gif) /[Sanity And Compassion](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/sanityandcompassion.gif), which deploys the [Coruscant: Galactic Senate](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/coruscantgalacticsenate.gif) and any Epsiode I location (most use [Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/coruscantjedicouncilchamber.gif). After that you want to load up on some senators ([Senator Palpatine](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/senatorpalpatine.gif) will be your star, however other good options include [Horox Ryyder](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/horoxryyder.gif), [Horox Ryyder](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/horoxryyder.gif) and [Yarua](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/yarua.gif)) and, of course the 4 Political Effects: [Ascertaining The Truth](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/ascertainingthetruth.gif), [I Will Not Defer](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/iwillnotdefer.gif), [Plea To The Court](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/pleatothecourt.gif), and [The Gravest Of Circumstances](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/thegravestofcircumstances.gif) (which affect Force drains for you and your opponent and battle destiny draws, for you and your opponent). A neat trick is to use [Queen Amidala, Ruler Of Naboo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/queenamidalarulerofnaboo.gif) in multiples, since she can be placed on the Political Effects in multiples, since she is not a senator, and the effects can be used so long as no senator is placed on them. The final card you will need is the [Senate Hovercam](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/senatehovercam.gif), which is from the Theed Palace expansion (and pullable by Wokling (V), which is from the Endor expansion, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0). After finding room for those cards, you are free to develop whatever strategy you&#8217;d like with the rest of your deck. One common strategy is to use the characters with built-in weapons (generally found in the Enhanced Premiere Packs, or Qui-Gon Jinn With Lightsaber from the Theed Palace expansion) to fight the opponent aggressively, knowing that you have Palpatine to help you keep even power-wise.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taking back Theed Palace</span>  
_After Queen Amidala insists on going back to Naboo, she announces her plan to go into the Throne Room and capture the viceroy._  
The objective card [We Have A Plan](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/wehaveaplan.gif) / [They Will Be Lost And Confused](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/theywillbelostandconfused.gif) (Theed Palace expansion) deploys [Naboo: Theed Palace Throne Room](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/nabootheedpalacethroneroom.gif), [Naboo: Theed Palace Courtyard](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/nabootheedpalacecourtyard.gif) (both from the Coruscant expansion) and the [Naboo: Theed Palace Hallway](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/nabootheedpalacehallway.gif) (Theed Palace). It limits which characters you are allowed to use, so a similar character base as described above for the escape from Tatooine deck- use the Jedi like Qui-Gon and Mace Windu and the good republic characters like Padme and Panaka. The personas from the Theed Palace expansion ([Queen Amidala](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/queenamidala.gif) and [Panaka, Protector Of The Queen](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/TheedPalace-Light/large/panakaprotectorofthequeen.gif)) of each of those are very good, and Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master (Reflections III expansion) deploys -2 to Naboo. After that, you will want weapons to help you fight you way into (and gain control of) that Throne Room.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The final Lightsaber duel between the Jedi and Maul</span>  
_Pretty much the only time it&#8217;s appropriate (and expected) to make sound effects and hum the &#8220;Duel of the Fates&#8221; soundtract while playing cards._  
Just as it is with the Dark Side version above, Lightsaber combat is defined on the Reflections III objective, [We&#8217;ll Handle This](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/wellhandlethis.gif) / [Duel Of The Fates](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/duelofthefates.gif), which deploys [Naboo: Theed Palace Generator](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/nabootheedpalacegenerator.gif) and [Naboo: Theed Palace Generator Core](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/nabootheedpalacegeneratorcore.gif), as well as the Epic Event [Inner Strength](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/innerstrength.gif). From there, you want Jedi, Jedi, Jedi. Your best lightsaber combat-er is easily [Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/quigonjinnjedimaster.gif) (and his destiny 5 lightsaber, [Qui-Gon&#8217;s Lightsaber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/quigonslightsaber.gif)) (both from the Reflections III expansion).  In addition to Jedi, you also want cards with high destiny, meaning [Yoda, Master Of The Force](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/yodamasteroftheforce.gif) (Reflections III expansion) is another good option, as well as his destiny 5 interrupt that cancels battle damage against you ([Are You Brain Dead?!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/areyoubraindead.gif), from the Coruscant expansion).  Also keeping with the &#8220;high destiny&#8221; theme (although not necessarily the Episode I lightsaber combat theme), [Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/lukeskywalkerjediknight.gif) (Death Star II) and [Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Light/large/landocalrissianscoundrel.gif) (Reflections III expansion) are also excellent additions to the deck. Your goal with the deck is simple: use the fact that you have 2 locations on the table where you can drain for 2 to cause damage &#8211; and if the opponent tries to fight you on Naboo, try to evade the battles (with cards such as [Rebel Barrier](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/rebelbarrier.gif) from Premiere expansion, [Blast The Door, Kid!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Light/large/blastthedoorkid.gif) from the A New Hope expansion and [Dodge](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Light/large/dodge.gif) from the Cloud City expansion), and cause damage though lightsaber combat.

### Dark Side

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using the Death Star to blow up planets</span>  
_At Grand Moff Tarkin and Admiral Motti&#8217;s urging, the Empire finally demonstrates the firepower of the Death Star battle station._  
Using the Death Star to blow up planets can be a fun theme. It (obviously) requires the [Death Star](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Dark/large/deathstar.gif) and the [Superlaser](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Dark/large/superlaser.gif), and then the Epic Event [Commence Primary Ignition](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Dark/large/commenceprimaryignition.gif) (all three of which are from the A New Hope expansion), which help you attempt that monumental task of destroying an entire planet. In order to make sure your attempt is successful, you will also need cards like [Death Star Gunner](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Dark/large/deathstargunner.gif) (A New Hope) in multiples and Death Star sites (such as [Death Star: Conference Room](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Dark/large/deathstarconferenceroom.gif), A New Hope), as well as the system card of the planet you are trying to blow away (although remember, many Light Side decks may deploy their own system card for the planet that their deck focuses on). One way to try setting this all up is with the objective card, [Set Your Course For Alderaan](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Dark/large/setyourcourseforalderaan.gif) / [The Ultimate Power In The Universe](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Dark/large/theultimatepowerintheuniverse.gif) (from the Third Anthology). That card will help set up everything you need (and also let you still go first, as using the Death Star by itself as your starting location allows the Light Side to go first), however it restricts the planets that you may try to blow away. The effect [A Million Voices Crying Out](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/amillionvoicescryingout.gif) (Tatooine expansion) helps that objective out, as once you use it to blow away Alderaan you can deploy Star Destroyers for cheap. Another nice card for the deck is Tarkin&#8217;s Doctrine (which is a virtualized version out of Virtual Set 0, using the card Fear Will Keep Them In Line that causes the opponent to lose Force when you use Star Destroyers and the Death Star).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Darth Vader striking down Obi-Wan and destroying all of the Jedi</span>  
_After destroying Obi-Wan on the Death, Vader thought he had extinguished that last of the Jedi._  
One of the most powerful and stable deck types there has ever been in the game,[Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/huntdownanddestroythejedi.gif) /[Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/theirfirehasgoneoutoftheuniverse.gif) (Special Edition expansion) is essentially a Dark Side deck that lets you use all of the main characters to fight the opponent off of his sites. It deploys two _Executor_ sites from Darth Vader&#8217;s command ship: [Executor: Holotheatre](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Dark/large/executorholotheatre.gif) and [Executor: Meditation Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Dark/large/executormeditationchamber.gif), as well as the game-changing Effect, [Visage Of The Emperor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Dark/large/visageoftheemperor.gif) (all three of which are from the Dagobah expansion). The deck works simply like this: if you can keep Darth Vader at a battleground and keep Jedi (and Luke) off the table, the Light Side is losing a Force _every_ turn &#8211; if you can&#8217;t you and your opponent will be losing that Force each turn. Obviously this deck wants to run multiple copies of Darth Vader and other main characters (including the Emperor and even Darth Maul, Boba Fett, Mara Jade, etc.), and also a [Blizzard 4](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/blizzard4.gif) (Reflections III) or two, since that is a powerful card in its own right, but also lets you deploy Vader from your Reserve Deck (for free!). Some versions of the will use [Imperial Arrest Order & Secret Plans](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/imperialarrestorder&secretplans.gif) (Coruscant) to get docking bay sites for Vader to go to (if you use the Death Star docking bay, you can also use [Put All Sections On Alert](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/putallsectionsonalert.gif) (Special Edition) to help you in battles both on the Death Star and on the _Executor_ if they try to cancel your Visage Of The Emperor), other decks use [Conduct Your Search](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/conductyoursearch.gif) (Reflections III) to deploy the [Endor: Back Door](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Endor-Dark/large/endorbackdoor.gif), which is an exterior battleground (perfect for Blizzard 4) where the Dark Side can Force drain for 2, causing some early pressure. Some versions of the deck do use the characters&#8217; lightsabers, others do not.

### Light Side

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Luke on Tatooine</span>  
_As a young farmboy on Tatooine yearns for adventure, he finally leaves the Moisture Farm behind_.  
Several side themes exist to simulate a young Luke Skywalker working on his farm, including [Harvest](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/harvest.gif) (Special Edition), which rewards Luke for his work on the farm with his Aunt and Uncle (including the [Owen Lars & Beru Lars](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/owenlars&berulars.gif) combo card from Reflections II expansion) by letting you hand-pick upto 4 cards to get back from your Lost Pile. This theme can be set up by I Must Be Allowed To Speak (V) (from Jabba&#8217;s Palace expansion, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0), which deploys the [Tatooine: Lars&#8217; Moisture Farm](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/tatooinelarsmoisturefarm.gif) from your Reserve Deck and also lets you selectively get certain cards into hand to further help you set it up.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hiring Han and dealing with Smugglers in the Cantina</span>  
_Needing a transport to Alderaan, Luke and company go to the Tatooine Cantina to look for a safe transport amongst a wretched hive of scum and villainy of smugglers and pirates._  
The objective [Watch Your Step](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/watchyourstep.gif) / [This Place Can Be A Little Rough](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/thisplacecanbealittlerough.gif) (Reflections II) starts off by deploying the familiar locations of the Tatooine system (most players opt to use the version released in the Coruscant expansion), [Tatooine: Docking Bay 94](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/tatooinedockingbay94.gif) (where Luke and Ben go to pick up the _Falcon_) and [Tatooine: Cantina](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/tatooinecantina.gif) (where they shop around for a pilot to fly them to Alderaan). The deck focuses on using smugglers such as Han Solo and Chewbacca to either duke it out in the Cantina or in their space ships, including trying to do the [Kessel Run](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/kesselrun.gif) (Premiere) in less than 12 parsecs. Outside of the &#8220;smugglers or Luke&#8221; character restriction, the deck is pretty wide open. You&#8217;ll want to pick which version(s) of Han to use (two popular versions include [Han With Heavy Blaster Pistol](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedPremiere-Light/large/hanwithheavyblasterpistol.gif) from the Enhanced Premiere Pack to fight on the ground and [Captain Han Solo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Light/large/captainhansolo.gif) from the Cloud City expansion to fight it out in space), and of course you will need the [Millennium Falcon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/millenniumfalcon.gif) (Premiere) as well. Other good smugglers include [Wedge Antilles](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Light/large/wedgeantilles.gif) (A New Hope expansion) (and his starship from the Death Star II expansion, [Red Squadron 1](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/redsquadron1.gif)) and [Lando With Blaster Pistol](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Light/large/landowithblasterpistol.gif) (from the Enhanced Cloud City Pack). Additionally, the deck can use characters from outside the movies, drawing from Star Wars&#8217;s rich Expanded Universe. These cards, which are all from the Reflections II expansion, include [Talon Karrde](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/talonkarrde.gif), [Dash Rendar](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/dashrendar.gif) (and his ship, _[Outrider](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/outrider.gif)_), and [Mirax Terrik](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/miraxterrik.gif) (and her ship, _[Pulsar Skate](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Light/large/pulsarskate.gif)_, which also has a virtual version from Virtual Set 0 that has Booster as a built-in pilot). Once you get some smugglers on the table, the Dark Side&#8217;s resources are cut down a little bit (with their activation at non-battlegrounds limited and they cannot use Sense or Alter) and the smugglers get a bit of a boost (in Force activation, forfeit and adding a battle destiny) and they can sneak in some hidden resources (by playing Interrupts from their Lost Pile).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rescuing Princess Leia from the Death Star prison</span>  
_Scheduled to be terminated, Princess Leia awaits her fate in a prison cell, hoping for a short stormtrooper to come and save her day._  
While not a common or popular deck (due to the difficulty in pulling off the objective) [Rescue The Princess](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/rescuetheprincess.gif) / [Sometimes I Amaze Even Myself](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/sometimesiamazeevenmyself.gif) (Special Edition expansion) starts by having Leia (usually [Prisoner 2187](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/prisoner2187.gif) from the Third Anthology) imprisoned at the [Death Star: Detention Block Corridor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/deathstardetentionblockcorridor.gif) (Special Edition), along with some sites to get her from the Death Star to Yavin IV, including, [Death Star: Docking Bay 327](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/deathstardockingbay327.gif), [Yavin 4: Docking Bay](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/yavin4dockingbay.gif), and [Yavin 4: Massassi War Room](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/yavin4massassiwarroom.gif) (all from the Premiere expansion). Your goal, as the name implies, is to rescue Leia, and then move her to the War Room. Once you do that, the reward is great (letting you permanently remove characters from the game).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blowing away the Death Star</span>  
_Racing down the Death Star Trench, Luke takes the lead to fire the final blow into the Empire&#8217;s new battle station._  
Although not one of the top decks at the moment, the very thematic [Attack Run](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Light/large/attackrun.gif) (A New Hope) fire your [Proton Torpedoes](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/protontorpedoes.gif) (Premiere) when your starfighter (usually Luke Skywalker (V), the physical card from Premiere, the virtual slip from Virtual Set 0, who adds 3 to your total, piloting [Artoo-Detoo In Red 5](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/artoodetooinred5.gif), from the Third Anthology) races down the [Death Star: Trench](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ANewHope-Light/large/deathstartrench.gif) (A New Hope). Because this deck is very fragile (and requires you to play cards that are difficult for you to put on the table), it is not often played, however one way to try to set up an Attack Run is with the objective [Massassi Base Operations](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/massassibaseoperations.gif) / [One In A Million](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/oneinamillion.gif) (Third Anthology), which deploys the [Yavin 4](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/yavin4.gif) system and [Yavin 4: Docking Bay](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Light/large/yavin4dockingbay.gif), and from there can help you set up your Attack Run, including deploy the Light Side version of the [Death Star](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/deathstar.gif), so that you have something to blow away. Also, if you are able to accomplish the feat, not only will your opponent be crippled from all of the Force loss he must endure, but you get rewarded with some Force retrieval and cheaper starship deloy via [Great Shot, Kid!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/greatshotkid.gif) (Tatooine expansion).

### Dark Side

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assault on Hoth</span>  
_March your AT-ATs into Echo Base._  
[You May Start Your Landing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Dark/large/youmaystartyourlanding.gif) (Tatooine expansion) drives the &#8220;walker deck,&#8221; both by setting up your sites ([Hoth: Ice Plains (5th Marker)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Dark/large/hothiceplains.gif) and [Hoth: Defensive Perimeter (3rd Marker)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Dark/large/hothdefensiveperimeter.gif)) and causing the opponent to take damage by marching your walkers into their base. You will want a good mixture of AT-AT walkers: Blizzard 1 and Blizzard 2 (both from the Hoth expansion, noting that Blizzard 2 was virtualized in Virtual Set 0, as well), [Tempest 1](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Endor-Dark/large/tempest1.gif) (Endor expansion) and [Blizzard 4](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/blizzard4.gif) (Reflections III). There are also non-unique walkers you can include, such as the [Blizzard Walker](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Dark/large/blizzardwalker.gif) (from the Hoth expansion) and the [Imperial Walker](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/imperialwalker.gif) (from the Parker Bros. Empire Strikes Back Introductory 2-player Game) (noting that the Imperial Walker is much cheaper and has a permanent pilot aboard already). If you are able to get enough Walkers out, you can also set up a turn of strong Force drains with [Walker Garrison](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/walkergarrison.gif) (also from the Empire Strikes Back 2-player game). Other key effects can include As for additional locations, you can use the Starting Interrupt Combat Readiness (V) (physical card is from Endor expansion, the virtual slip is from Virtual Set 0), which lets you start the 5th Marker and Hoth system, in addition to your 3 effects (which, besides You May Start Your Landing could include [Prepare For A Surface Attack](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/prepareforasurfaceattack.gif) (Reflections III expansion) or [Imperial Decree](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/imperialdecree.gif) (Cloud City expansion), or [Security Precautions](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Endor-Dark/large/securityprecautions.gif) (Endor expansion)). Another good location is the [Hoth: Mountains (6th Marker)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/hothmountains.gif) (from the Empire Strikes Back 2-player game), or you can use [Imperial Arrest Order & Secret Plans](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/imperialarrestorder&secretplans.gif) to grab the Hoth: Docking Bay to get another battleground, which will help you set up [Rebel Base Occupation](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/rebelbaseoccupation.gif) (Special Edition). Your character selection can vary, but generally, you will use Imperials who work well with the AT-ATs, including General Veers (V) (Hoth expansion, Virtual Set 0), who draws 2 battle destiny on his own while piloting one, and [Commander Igar](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Endor-Dark/large/commanderigar.gif) (Endor expansion), who also can drawn 2 battle destiny while piloting either Tempest 1 or an Imperial Walker.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garrison on Cloud City</span>  
_Darth Vader landed his troops onto Cloud City and forced Lando to make a Dark Deal._  
Controlling Cloud City can have very powerful game effects, as shown from [Dark Deal](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/darkdeal.gif) (Cloud City). That effect can have game-changing impact, as it increases your Force drains by 2 and makes you stronger at your sites when they try to knock you off of them.  The objective [This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Dark/large/thisdealisgettingworseallthetime.gif) / [Pray I Don&#8217;t Alter It Any Further](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Dark/large/prayidontalteritanyfurther.gif) (Enhanced Cloud City) can help set up Dark Deal by pulling the cards you need to play it (including [Bespin: Cloud City](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/bespincloudcity.gif)). That objective also helps you set up even more Force loss for the opponent by grabbing both [Cloud City Occupation](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/cloudcityoccupation.gif) (Special Edition) and [Bespin](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/bespin.gif) (Cloud City) from your Reserve Deck. Another must-have combo for the deck is [They Must Never Again Leave This City](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/theymustneveragainleavethiscity.gif) (Reflections III) and Darth Vader&#8217;s command ship, _[Executor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Dark/large/executor.gif)_ (Dagobah) &#8211; which deploys for free and helps protect that Cloud City Occupation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carbon freezing Han Solo</span>  
_Vader insisted on testing the carbon-freezing procees on Han Solo before using it on Luke Skywalker._  
Freezing someone inside a carbonite block can be accomplished within the game in two ways. The first is [All Too Easy](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/alltooeasy.gif) (Cloud City expansion), which you can utilize whenever you hit someone with a lightsaber at the [Cloud City: Carbonite Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/cloudcitycarbonitechamber.gif) (Cloud City expansion). However, the process can be more fully explored (and cause Force loss) thru [Carbon-Freezing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/carbonfreezing.gif) (Cloud City expansion). The most efficient way of pulling this off is by using the objective, [Carbon Chamber Testing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/carbonchambertesting.gif) / [My Favorite Decoration](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/myfavoritedecoration.gif) (Special Edition expansion), which lets you start the game with one of the opponent&#8217;s characters as your captive, who you carbon-freeze. That card requires you to play the Carbonite Chamber, the Security Tower (Cloud City expansion, but note that the Virtual Set 0 version adds an additional Force icon for you!) and [Carbonite Chamber Console](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/carbonitechamberconsole.gif), which adds in your attempts to freeze someone. Once you actually freeze a captive, if you deliver them to Jabba&#8217;s Palace, you can reap the benefits of that objective. Or, another way to play the deck is to skip over the freezing process and use [Jabba&#8217;s Prize](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Dark/large/jabbasprizefront.gif) (Reflections II), which is [an already frozen version of Han](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Dark/large/jabbasprizeback.gif). By skipping the need to freeze someone, you speed the deck up (you also trade off the Force loss from carbon-freezing with the capture of a powerful Light Side persona). (Note: some players use this set up with [Any Methods Necessary](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Dark/large/anymethodsnecessary.gif) as their starting interrupt, to get IG-88 (V) (Dagobah card, virtual slip in Virtual Set 0), who, while he is escorting Jabba&#8217;s Prize, gets to search your Force pile every turn. This can be combined with Despair (V), a Cloud City Effect that was virtualized in Virtual Set 1 to create bonuses where Jabba&#8217;s Prize is)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dueling Luke Skywalker to convert him to the Dark Side</span>  
_The epic final confrontation where Vader revealed the truth to Luke about his lineage._  
[Epic Duel](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/epicduel.gif) (Cloud City) is a card that simulates a very important confrontation between Darth Vader and either Obi-Wan or Luke Skywalker.  You will need the interrupts necessary to start the duel: [Vader&#8217;s Obsession](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/PremiereIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/vadersobsession.gif) (Parker Bros. Premiere Introductory Two-player game) for Luke or [The Circle Is Now Complete](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Dark/large/thecircleisnowcomplete.gif) (Premiere) for Obi-Wan.  Also, you may use other cards that help you in the duels, including [Darth Vader&#8217;s Lightsaber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Dark/large/darthvaderslightsaber.gif) (Death Star II) or [Focused Attack](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Dark/large/focusedattack.gif) (Cloud City), which can help increase your totals.  Also note, that if you duel in a battle, [Grand Moff Tarkin](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Premiere-Dark/large/grandmofftarkin.gif) (Premiere) can cancel one of their duel destinies, and also [Mara Jade, The Emperor&#8217;s Hand](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedJabbasPalace-Dark/large/marajadetheemperorshand.gif) can be used as a substitute target for Vader.  Finally, if you really want to fix your duel totals, use [Dark Rage](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/darkrage.gif) to pull [Deep Hatred](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/deephatred.gif).  Although it is also mentioned in the Episode IV cards, [Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/huntdownanddestroythejedi.gif) /[Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/theirfirehasgoneoutoftheuniverse.gif) (Special Edition) can be used to start Epic Duel on the table.

### Light Side

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Echo Base Operations</span>  
_The Rebels set up a new secret base on the ice planet of Hoth._  
While on Hoth, the Rebels can avail themselves of the protection of their Energy Shield, which effectively creates a safe haven for them by preventing the Dark Side from deploying directly to any of the Echo Sites or first few markers.  The energy shield is created by [Hoth: Main Power Generators (1st Marker)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/hothmainpowergenerators.gif), and because it extends to at least the first three marker sites, unless the Dark Side has the 4th, 5th or 6th marker on table already, it automatically deploys [Hoth: North Ridge (4th Marker)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/hothnorthridge.gif) from your Reserve Deck (both Hoth expansion cards). A powerful strategy to take advantage of this shield is to set up [Echo Base Operations](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/echobaseoperations.gif) (Hoth), which increases your drains and power in space.  A quick way to set this up is to use Careful Planning (V) (physical card is from Endor, virtual slip is from Virtual Set 0) to deploy the 1st (and likely 4th) marker and the Hoth system, as well as 3 effects, one of which is [A New Secret Base](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/anewsecretbase.gif) (Third Anthology), which essentially grabs all the cards you need to set up Echo Base Operations.  A quick path to setting it up is to use A New Secret Base to pull [Echo Base Garrison](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ThirdAnthology-Light/large/echobasegarrison.gif) (Third Anthology), and use the characters that card pulls, including [Derek &#8216;Hobbie&#8217; Klivian](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/derekhobbieklivian.gif) (Hoth) and [Commander Luke Skywalker](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/commanderlukeskywalker.gif) (V) (from Hoth expansion, but his virtual text is from Virtual Set 0) &#8211; Luke then can pull speeders and while on [Rogue 1](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Hoth-Light/large/rogue1.gif) (Hoth) draws 2 battle destiny.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fleeing into the asteroid field</span>  
_&#8220;You&#8217;re not actually going into an asteroid field???&#8221;_  
Asteroid Fields are locations like any other, except they have special rules (see the [rules](http://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/rules/) page for more details) that simulate the risk a starfighter (or even star destroyer!) faces when flying in an asteroid field.  However, if you&#8217;re willing to risk getting blown up by a giant space rock, you can reap the benefits through some cards such [Asteroid Sanctuary](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/asteroidsanctuary.gif) or [Asteroids Do Not Concern Me](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/asteroidsdonotconcernme.gif), or even the drain bonuses on the [Big One](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/bigone.gif) or drain canceling text on [Asteroid Field](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/asteroidfield.gif) (all cards are from the Dagobah expansion).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jedi training</span>  
_After Obi-Wan told him to go to Dagobah, Luke sought out Master Yoda to beginning his Jedi training._  
The [Dagobah](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/dagobah.gif) system itself sets up most of what you need to start training your character to be a Jedi by pulling Dagobah locations, including [Dagobah: Training Area](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/dagobahtrainingarea.gif), which also pulls any Jedi Test.  However if you use the objective [Mind What You Have Learned](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/mindwhatyouhavelearned.gif) /[Save You It Can](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/saveyouitcan.gif), at the expense of having your characters not being able to Force drain or retrieve Force at Dagobah locations (which, just as they were in the movie, were very secluded and difficult for anyone to get to), you can get set up much, much more quickly. Generally, you will want [Yoda](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/yoda.gif) (Dagobah expansion) and an apprentice, usually [Daughter Of Skywalker](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Endor-Light/large/daughterofskywalker.gif) (V) (physical card from Endor, slips from Virtual Set 0) (since training Leia frees up the Luke persona to go and battle), and all of the Dagobah sites and Jedi Tests (each from the [Dagobah expansion](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/DagobahType.html)) (note, however: [Jedi Test 6](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/youmustconfrontvader.gif) is from the Death Star II expansion).  Other cards that will help you out in Jedi testing are [Yoda&#8217;s Hope](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/yodashope.gif), [At Peace](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/atpeace.gif), and [Luke&#8217;s Backpack](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Dagobah-Light/large/lukesbackpack.gif) (all from the Dagobah expansion), [Wise Advice](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/wiseadvice.gif) (Special Edition), and [The Way Of Things](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/thewayofthings.gif) (Death Star II), which will help you bypass Jedi Test 3, which is difficult to actually attempt.

_Once a small operation on Bespin, Lando Calrissian set up a gas mining colony where the final act of the film took place._  
[Quiet Mining Colony](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Light/large/quietminingcolony.gif) / [Independent Operation](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Light/large/independentoperation.gif) (Enhanced Cloud City) starts any Cloud City battleground (usually players select a site that has 2 Light Side Force icons, but only allows the Dark Side to drain for 1 at, such as [Cloud City: West Gallery](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/cloudcitywestgallery.gif) (Special Edition)) and the [Bespin](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Light/large/bespin.gif) (Cloud City expansion) system. You will want Beldon&#8217;s Eye (V) (physical card from Cloud City expansion, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0) to deploy Harc Seff (V) (physical card from Special Edition, virtual slip from Virtual Set 0), and the Overseer (which is a virtual card from Virtual Set 0 that requires the [Z-95 Bespin Defense Fighter](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EnhancedCloudCity-Light/large/z95bespindefensefighter.gif) card from Enhanced Cloud City) and will absolutely need [Keeping The Empire Out Forever](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/Tatooine-Light/large/keepingtheempireoutforever.gif) (Tatooine) as it not only makes flipping your objective possible, but it gives you a worthwhile benefit to doing so by &#8220;mining&#8221; through your Force pile. Since you will be deploying plenty of Cloud City sites, [Cloud City Celebration](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Light/large/cloudcitycelebration.gif) (Special Edition) seems like a no-brainer, and [Path Of Least Resistance](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/CloudCity-Light/large/pathofleastresistance.gif) (Cloud City) can help you avoid battle, move into battle, spread and drain (and then retrieve with Celebration), or move around whenever you please. Your character base is unrestricted, so you can use strong Jedi or weak aliens, but the flip side of the objective does give benefits to aliens, so generally players work some of those in, including [Pucumir Thryss](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/JabbasPalace-Light/large/pucumirthryss.gif) and [Yoxgit](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/JabbasPalace-Light/large/yoxgit.gif) (who, for some reason, are actually in the Jabba&#8217;s Palace expansion)
