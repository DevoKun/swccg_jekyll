After many years of discussions in the community the Players Committee has finally decided to agree to the use of “unlimited shields” under your Starting Effects. The not quite correct but commonly used phrase “unlimited shields” means that a player can now put a copy of each Defensive Shield under their Starting Effect. Virtual Defensive Shields (for example You Cannot Hide Forever (V)) can usually do more than the normal defensive shield of the same name (You Cannot Hide Forever). The only notable exception is A Useless Gesture, where both the virtual and non-virtual cards have different, but useful text.

Jabba’s Prize (V) is another card affected by this. It will still function as it had previously, but an errata will remove the now redundant text to “subtract one from the number of cards you may place under your starting effect”.

You can still only play 4 defensive shields per game (unless other cards like Cold Feet (V) allow you to play more), so “shield busting” is still a possible side strategy. But from now on you don’t have to worry about forgetting a shield, or making a decklist error with one of the shields. Shields won’t have to be listed on the decklist form anymore. You simply write down your starting effect and Jabba’s Prize (V). The updated errata sheet will be uploaded to the virtual cards section, and the updated decklist will be uploaded to the tournament resources area of our homepage soon. We wanted to give you the news as soon as possible and hope that you enjoy this simplification for tournament play.

There are 2 further errata: to the First Order Stormtrooper and F-11D Blaster Rifle. These errata are meant to balance the synergy of the recent “First Order Court” deck.

**Following is a list of all the errata:**

•Anger, Fear, Aggression (V)  
[Set 0 &#8211; Dagobah &#8211; C]  
STARTING EFFECT  
Text: Deploy on table **with any number of Defensive Shields** from outside your deck face-down here. Four times per game, may play a card from here (as if from hand). Unless canceling your Interrupt, opponent may not play Uncertain Is The Future until the end of your first turn.
