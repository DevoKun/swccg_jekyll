Greetings, Star Wars players!

With a new year, it&#8217;s a time of new beginnings, and I can think of no better time than to announce changes with the Design Intern program.

You might recall that in the wake of the 10th Anniversary Design Contest, we started an intern program with some folks who applied and/or were awarded a trial membership via the contest. In the intervening years they have been working with me and development behind the scenes, really getting a taste at what things are like.

This past set, the design team they really took a strong leadership role and contributed to making the set a success in my absence. The team really stepped up, and the result is evident in the quality of the cards produced. Because of this success, and after discussing with the other Advocates, we have decided that we are going to reconstitute the Design Team and use the majority of the intern team as the main Design Team.

I&#8217;m going to take more of an oversight role and let the designers work on future sets, with me popping in as the feeling takes me. Instead, my goal is to work more closely with development. I&#8217;ll still be around to be a voice for communication as I have been in the past.

Now that The Force Awakens is out, we are going to plot out future sets and start working on them somewhat ahead of time, since we have a good deal of manpower and experience in the team now. Much like Matt took the lead with set 3, Jarad is taking the lead with Set 4 and we&#8217;ll share our set lineup, and the leads with you in the future. Depending on how things go, we might look to get more interns in the future, but we have no plans for that currently.

Enjoy 2016!!!
