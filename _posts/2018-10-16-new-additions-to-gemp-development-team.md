I&#8217;m pleased to announce that we have added 3 new members to the GEMP development team!

Cal (caldred)  
Andrew A. (zebbeni)  
Kristian (rax)

These 3 have hit the ground running and have already started working with the tenured developers on the workflow and process improvements. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what they add to the team in the coming weeks and months!
