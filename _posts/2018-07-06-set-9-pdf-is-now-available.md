The PDF for Set 9 is officially available!

<https://www.starwarsccg.org/virtual/Set-9.pdf>

The set is tournament legal in one week, so starting July 13 you&#8217;re free to play with any of these cards.

Big thanks goes out to all the teams involved: Design & Development, Playtesting, Proofing, and Graphics for all their hard work this set. We couldn&#8217;t do this without all you guys!

Enjoy!
