Greetings SWCCG Players!

It is with great pleasure that the SWCCG PC can officially release Set 6. I would like to thank all of the players for their patience and understanding with the delay of the PDF release. I endeavor to make all of our stated release dates moving forward.

The Set 6 PDF can be found at the below link and on the Downloads page. I personally think this might be the most visually appealing set we have released to date. Kudos to the Graphic Design team for their work here, to the playtesting team forÂ their critical work in refining these cards, and the Design and Development teams for the long hours and back and forth on the concepts.

Good luck and MTFBWY!
