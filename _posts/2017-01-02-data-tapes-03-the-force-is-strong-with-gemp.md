First off, happy new year! For too many reasons, I wasn&#8217;t able to play or write much in the last few weeks. I think people call that &#8220;real life,&#8221; but regardless, I thought it was time I churned something out even if it isn&#8217;t top-of-the-line, grade A gaming journalism you&#8217;ve come to expect from Data Tapes!

So, here&#8217;s a plug article for an awesome new program for playing Star Wars CCG! The program is called [GEMP](http://tlbiesterfeld.servegame.com/gemp-swccg/), and for this article I&#8217;m going to pit it against Holotable so you can see for yourself the pros and cons that each program has over the other.

       It&#8217;s gonna get a little rough in here.

### **Rules Automation**

This is probably the biggest difference between the two programs. Holotable is a true tabletop simulator with very few added functions, mostly just shortcuts for searching piles that are placed in certain zones. GEMP, on the other hand, has full rules automation. So, in Holotable, if you want to spend 3 force to play We Must Accelerate Our Plans for the effect pull, you press<img class="size-medium wp-image-10239 alignright" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/wemustaccelerateourplans-214x300.gif" alt="" width="214" height="300" /> the spend force key 3 times, play the card from your hand, maybe type a short explanation into the chat box so your opponent knows what you&#8217;re doing, then hit the search reserve deck key to look through and find a valid target for the effect. In GEMP, We Must Accelerate Our Plans is highlighted whenever  
you have priority, and when you click on it, if you have 3 force, the option for the effect pull, as well as options for each other use of the card, appear as a menu over the card. You simply click on the Search Reserve Deck for an Effect option and your deck appears before you, with valid targets outlined (and only those outlined cards are clickable).

Another plus for rules automation, and thus GEMP, is that it can help you quickly learn the more subtle rules for priority, or, when you can play cards. It actually helps for learning a lot of rules.

One thing I will say in favor of Holotable is the ability to take back a move. If you make a mistake in GEMP, it is set in stone, and there is no way to undo it. This is especially painful when skipping phases. If you aren&#8217;t careful with your clicks, you can easily skip a phase, which in many cases can really cost you the game.

### **Available Card Pool**</h3>

    Holding our breath for this one.

GEMP is programmed solely by forum member Tbiesty (go thank him [here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=964&t=52599)). Having rules automation means that every card must be programmed in to take effect exactly as it should. This would be difficult for any game, but with Star Wars, I honestly can&#8217;t imagine how he does it, because there are so many rules and nuances that have to be taken into account. All of that said, not every card has been programmed in yet. He does seem to add cards almost daily though, so it is only a matter of time before the entire card pool is available. Right now it has right over 2500 cards.

Holotable has all of the cards already available, and is usually updated within a week of a new set being released. This is one category where Holotable is, at present, the clear winner. Adapting to the ever changing GEMP meta-game is fun too, though.

### **Sealed Deck**</h3>

    Remember these great cards? Now is your chance to use &#8217;em in sealed! RIP Leia!!!

One really fun feature of GEMP is the ability to play sealed deck games. And not just single games, but entire leagues. Even though the card pools are often horrible, it is fun to mix it up every once in awhile and play something other than constructed. You can get similar functionality out of Holotable using the Create Random Deck function, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen someone hosting a sealed game on the Holotable server.

Which brings me to my last point,

### **Player Base**

I just logged in to GEMP and there are 12 players in the lobby, and 4 active games being played (which you can watch right in your browser, another pretty sweet feature). I logged onto the Holotable server, and I am the only one there, besides what I think are some crickets chirping in the distance. GEMP is a clear winner in this category. Even if more people are using Holotable (which I&#8217;m honestly not sure of at this point), they aren&#8217;t logged onto the server waiting for games, they are planning games ahead of time and going from there. GEMP is the perfect solution to just wanting to pop online and find a match.

On that note, there is also a geMPC being organized, which will be the first big event ran on GEMP. So if you really want to jump right in, go to [this thread](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=494&t=63897) and send Batmouse a PM with your info to sign up. There&#8217;s even prizes, and it should be a ton of fun. There&#8217;s already over 20 players signed up, so come join the party!

In conclusion, I think both of these programs are great for their own reasons, but I&#8217;m very excited to see GEMP continue to grow in popularity because I think it is the most user friendly and fun way to play the game besides the real thing. I&#8217;m usually on there lurking, so come say hi. Hope to see you on there soon!
