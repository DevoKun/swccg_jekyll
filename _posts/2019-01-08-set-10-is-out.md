**Set 10 has finally been released and you can find it here:**  
<https://starwarsccg.org/virtual/Set-10.pdf>

As the advocates have said several times since the spoiler list was revealed on 19th December, **the cards will be legal for the Endor Grand Prix.** 

We apologize again for the close release of the final PDF, and are now working on coordinating set 11 more smoothly. 

Thanks again for the hard work to every-one in D&D, including play testing, proofing and graphics. The images look better with every set, and we were also working on the AIs for 2019. Endor will have the 2 new &#8220;Major Event Winner Top 9&#8221; AIs, and they will hopefully blow you away. The Top 16 of the OCS 2018 series will receive an exclusive Foil soon (not directly an AI, but we call it an &#8220;Art/Image Correction&#8221; of an older card that we couldn&#8217;t do right back then). 

Please also watch this space for an Update of the Document &#8220;Official AIs&#8221; soon:  
<https://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/virtual-slips/> 

We will add some of the older (2015/2016) AIs to the official PDF, so that everyone can print them out and use them officially. 

I hope you all have fun with this and enjoy the new cards!&nbsp;  
  
May the Force be with You
