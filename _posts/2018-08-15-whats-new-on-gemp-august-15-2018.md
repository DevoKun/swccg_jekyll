  * Commence Primary Ignition (V)
  * Vanee
  * Knights Of The Old Republic
  * Red 5
  * Scarif
  * Scarif: Beach
  * Scarif: Data Vault
  * Scarif: Turbolift Complex
  * Stardust
  * They Have No Idea We&#8217;re Coming

Additionally, some bug fixes are being deployed to fix issues with the following cards:

  * They Will Be No Match For You (V)
  * Galen Erso
  * General Walex Blissex (V)

Remaining Set 9 cards to release in GEMP are:

The above cards will be released as soon as the team can. We are all excited to complete Set 9 though, and move on to other additions to GEMP!

I hope you enjoy playing with the new cards!
