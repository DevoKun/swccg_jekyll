Hi everyone,

This fortnight, we’re remembering Eric White, a beloved member of the SWCCG community who passed away in 2011. I had the chance to interview Eric’s cousin, Chris Baker (eutychusrocks), and learn a little bit about Eric:

**NARP Fortnightly: First, leaving SWCCG aside, what can you tell us about Eric White as a person? For those of us who didn&#8217;t know him, what was he like?**

Chris Baker: Eric was kind, generous, and jovial. He always attempted to make those around him laugh. He loved games, and SWCCG was one of his favorites. You always felt like you were missing out if he invited you to do stuff and you couldn’t make it. He did not let his heart condition ruin his enthusiasm for life.

**NF: Do you have any good stories about Eric? (SWCCG-related or not)  
** 

CB: One thing that I always remember fondly was a large family Thanksgiving. All of us cousins played a few games and one of them was 1000 blank white cards. If you aren’t familiar with the game, it basically is a game where you make the cards as you play by adding titles, pictures, and text to index cards. You get to draw 1 card and play 1 card and the person with the most points once the draw pile is depleted wins. Eric made all his cards look like Star Wars cards with borders, destiny numbers, and lore.

Eric was also the person that breathed life in Star Wars CCG in Huntsville, AL. I only returned to the game because he put forth the effort to convince me once he found out I still had all my cards. We never got a huge group together, but we were able to get 8 and 10 players occasionally and that is mainly thanks to Eric’s enthusiasm for the game.

**NF: What was Eric like as a SWCCG player? Do you know how he got started in the game? Do you remember what his favorite cards were? Favorite decks?  
** 

CB: Eric got started playing (as far as I know) at the very beginning of Star Wars. I know he played the Decipher Star Trek game first and played both simultaneously while both games were still in print. He was a few years older than me and taught me how to play when I was in middle school about the same time Dagobah came out. He tried to get me good enough so that I would win a beginners’ tournament so He could get a Gift Of The Mentor t-shirt, but that didn’t happen. Eric was fond of playing Jawa decks, but he also would try weird theme decks like a light side deck that only used cards with snow in the picture. I know Eric was extremely excited about Center Of Tyranny and played that exclusively for light side as soon as the deck type came out. He loved the X-wing book series. Daroe was one of his favorite cards and regularly made it into quite a few of his decks.

**NF: Newer players (like me) know Eric&#8217;s name because of the R&#8217;tic Hweei card. Can you tell us anything about how that card came to be?**

CB: Eric was a participant in the design contest a few years back. If I remember correctly, he was on a team by himself and had lost in the first few rounds. The contest was still going on when he died. I was approached by the PC and they had asked what his favorite card was, which was Daroe. The PC then offered R’tic Hweei as a prize with the winner getting to design the virtual Daroe for the contest. Brian Herold won that round which was fitting since he was also part of our playgroup in Huntsville at the time.

**NF: I&#8217;ve heard stories about Eric&#8217;s great sense of humor. R&#8217;tic Hweei is one of the most frustrating cards in the game right now. Would Eric find that funny?**

CB: Yes. Eric would be proud to know there was a card out there made in his honor. Having that card be an annoying Jawa is just icing on the cake.

**Card of the Fortnight**** **

In honor of Eric, this fortnight’s card is the aforementioned [R’tic Hweei](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/rtichweei.gif) – an anagram of “Eric White.” As I mentioned, R’tic is one of the most frustrating cards to play against right now. This is mostly because of the combination with [Broken Concentration](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Dagobah-Dark/brokenconcentration.gif).

With this combo, every turn, you can spend one of your Force and one of your opponent’s Force to put a card from your opponent’s Force Pile on top of their Reserve Deck. You can do this on both players’ turns, which can add up to effectively -4 generation for your opponent. Combined with other ways to make the Light Side spend extra Force &#8212; such as [Greedo (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/greedo.gif), [Projective Telepathy](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/projectivetelepathy.gif), [I Can’t Shake Him! (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/icantshakehim.gif), and [First Strike](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/firststrike.gif) – you can really choke your opponent of resources and set up deadly First Strike beatdowns.

In a deck that plays the [Jabba’s Palace: Audience Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/jabbaspalaceaudiencechamber.gif), such as [Court Of The Vile Gangster](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/courtofthevilegangster.gif) or [Carbon Chamber Testing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/carbonchambertesting.gif), you can use the Audience Chamber to deploy R’tic, then use R’tic to find the other copy of himself. (He does have ‘sandcrawler’ in his game text after all!) Then [Jabba’s Haven](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/jabbashaven.gif) can retrieve him into hand once per game, so you can deploy him at least three times before you run out of R’tics.

What other uses can you think of for this pesky Jawa? Get creative and experiment!

That’s it for this fortnight. My thanks again to Chris Baker for talking to me for this article. Until next time…

Peace, Love, and High Destinies,
