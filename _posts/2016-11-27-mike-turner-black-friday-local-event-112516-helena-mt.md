This may be a bit long winded, so I apologize in advance. I guess you could chalk it up to my love for this awesome game.

Today was a bit of a dream come true for me. Ever since I began playing this game (especially competitively in the past few years), I have wanted to attend a tournament that I didn&#8217;t have to travel out of state for. I&#8217;m from Montana and our state playing community has never been bigger than a couple folks that I&#8217;ve known of. I&#8217;ve always thought to myself &#8220;one day I&#8217;ll hold Montana States and show the SWCCG community we actually do have a player base.&#8221; This game is very much alive! Here is my evidence:

Earlier this week I was feeling opportunistic and contacted ALL of the players in our area that I have played Star Wars Cards with. To my pleasant surprise many of us would be back in our hometown (Helena) for Thanksgiving, staying through the weekend. Perfect! I set the wheels in motion and started planning out an unofficial non PC sanctioned event. 5 people committed (the largest gathering in our state that I know of since the game went out of print). As Black Friday drew near I set my deck(s). I became increasingly worried about attendance. Being a family holiday weekend, I wouldn&#8217;t blame anyone who had last minute changes of plan. I called Helena&#8217;s Local Game Store (there is only one that I know of so a big shout out to White Knight) to find no reservations were necessary and that they opened early for the shopping holiday. 12 noon start time was set and info sent out to all players who had committed. The waiting game began&#8230;

Game Day arrived. 5 people in attendance! I couldn&#8217;t have asked for more! Actually, we had 6 attendees but one couldn&#8217;t stay long enough for a game. A big thanks to Travis, Steve, Kyle, Lewis and Clark for coming down. With our ENTIRE player base set the games began. I took the bye first so that I could take some game notes and watch the action go down in both matchups. No games were timed and a casual approach was taken to the format of the event (deck changes allowed between matches, players chose their matchups etc). As far as I could tell everyone had a blast!

Matchups:  
Round 1: Steve&#8217;s AOBS v Travis&#8217; Old Allies (Steve wins +5), Kyle&#8217;s CCT Iggy Freezer v Lewis&#8217; Tat CPv Mains (Kyle wins +8)  
Steve took the bye round 2. He had to head out after Round 1, but stuck around to watch a bit.  
Round 2: Kyle&#8217;s Court Scum v Mike&#8217;s Profit Racing (Mike wins +14), Lewis&#8217; Dark LSC v Travis&#8217; OA (Travis wins +21)

Results after 2 rounds:  
Travis 1-1 (+16)  
Mike 1-0 (+14)  
Steve 1-0 (+5)  
Kyle 1-1 (-6)  
Lewis 0-2 (-29)

Looks Like Steve and I need to match up one last time to compile complete results!

Here are some highlights and props from an awesome day:

AOBS v OA  
-Steve&#8217;s Emperor went missing to Lost in the Wilderness. He was found about 5 turns later.  
-Steve had an Elis Helrot (steve payed 1 to move) beat down for 17 overflow. Cad, Snoova, Jango, EPP Dengar creamed Corran Horn. Travis pulled bottom card of force with Rey as a last ditch effort. It was we&#8217;re doomed combo, but he didn&#8217;t have the force to pay for the houjix search.  
-Rebel flight suit v was played in this match up.  
-Travis had a great space presence and Steve couldn&#8217;t find any. It resulted in a very close game despite the huge beatdown.

CCT v Tat Mains  
-Kyle successfully froze Leia with blaster rifle on his second attempt (first attempt he drew 10 total). He got we&#8217;re the bait going (only caused 3 force loss total) and successfully lured Lewis into a trap to avoid more force loss.  
-Lewis played H1:DB and Jedi Luke there for cheap. Then db transit to Tatooine. He did this 3 times. I don&#8217;t recall the means of retrieval, but it was the same exact Luke every time.  
-Luke and Vader had a one on one confrontation in this game (both characters hit each other with their swords)  
-Kyle took a minor space presence midgame and Lewis was able to kick him off only a couple turns later. many traded blows all game and this one ended very close in the dark side&#8217;s favor.

Profit v court scum  
-This matchup was very strange. Virtually no damage was dealt as we built up our armies, but when the hammer fell it fell hard.  
-Kyle built up a nearly invincible army at the audience chamber. On my first attack at the AC (with nabrun) he captured Leia with Snoova and only lost two guys. Next turn he proceeded to move over to the dungeon and deliver Leia to retrieve both of his lost characters.  
-I was finally able to find a weak spot and saved Han and won the podrace. Huge retrieval swing and beginning the objective pings gave me the advantage in the game.

OA v Dark LSC (I didn&#8217;t get to see much of this one as it occurred while I was playing)  
-Rebel Flight Suit v saw play in both of Travis&#8217; games with OA. It went largely unused in both games.  
-Lewis got He Is Not Ready off so Rey had to move every turn. It resulted in Travis moving his fleet in front of armed Maul and choke Vader. Lewis responded by dropping Boba Fett, BH and clearing ALL of Travis&#8217; ability off the site.  
-Travis successfully got a foothold at the 3/2 and drained for 3/BB-8 for 1 for much of the mid/late game. He had the advantage in the damage race with a strong space presence as well.

Slops:  
-Squadron assignments was altered in one game. Both players let it slide despite it being played at start of game!  
-The guy who said &#8220;Man, its been forever since I&#8217;ve played that game!&#8221; and then promply shot me down when I offered a game.  
-Me. I should have tried to plan today out a bit earlier and get it sanctioned as an official MT states&#8230; Next time!

Upon completion of the games (we only had the 2 rounds) I bought a couple of BB-8 sleeves from the store and said goodbyes to my friends. I was and still am elated. The event turned out better than I could have imagined. It was always something that was doable, but just needed some organization. On my drive back home to Missoula i thought a lot about the day and where to go from here. I&#8217;m super excited about building a larger player base in my area. Today was a huge motivator! Thanks for reading through my report.

Finally, a bit of food for thought. I&#8217;ve seen it discussed in the forums what the strongest stand alone card in the game is. There are several, but only a few stood out as being the biggest hitters. My question is: What do you find to be the strongest 2-card combo in this game (unassisted by any other cards)? I look forward to responses!
