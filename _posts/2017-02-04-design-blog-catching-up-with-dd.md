Greetings SWCCG Players!

It&#8217;s been too long since my last Design Blog, so as I start writing this post I have the intention of fitting in quite a bit of information.

First off, we are one day out from the final day to submit your player survey, so if you haven&#8217;t done this already, please see this thread: <a href="http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=871&t=64230" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=871&t=64230</a>. The Advocates will be reading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> entries, so this is your chance to have your voice be heard!

I say this every Design Blog I think, but D&D and player creators are once again hard at work behind the scenes prepping the next set. The volunteers who continually push this further truly have a year round job. We had a small break in December for the holidays and prepping for the MPC, but it is truly amazing how they log in regularly and keep pounding away at the massive amount of cards in front of them (needless to say, not all will be making it into the next set, or possibly even the set after that). It feels like there are a record number of player cards in development, so kudos to the developers and player card developers who keep things moving with no end in sight (and what a wonderful thing that is!).

You all may have seen the announcement, but I want to mention it here as well. One of our long time developers, Matt Harrison-Trainor, has decided to step away from his role for a while as he prepares for a new chapter in his non-SWCCG life. He has been an amazing volunteer during his time on Development, and I wish him the best (and of course still hope to see him at major events). To fill his spot, we have chosen Chris Gogolen, who many of you know, and who also has plenty of experience with player card development, and with the Reset. I feel very lucky to maintain the high quality of the people on Development despite the loss of Matt. Development remains in good hands!

I expect the next set to be released sometime in late March or early April. My goal as always is to have it done 4-5 weeks prior to the next major event, which is the Endor Grand Prix May 5-7 (more info here if you haven&#8217;t seen already: <a href="http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=1007" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=1007</a>). It will be a relatively small set, which will introduce some of the best (and worst) from _Rogue One_ to the SWCCG world, and also include some cards that development deems important for the meta.

Following that, I would expect another set to be released before Worlds that will be introducing more new themes to the game.

One thing I teased on a while back was the possible re-emergence of a lot of players&#8217; favorite deck &#8212; Ralltiir Operations/In The Hands Of The Empire (better known as ROPS).

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3804" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/seralltiiroperationsdf-214x300.png" alt="" width="265" height="371" /><img class="alignnone " src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/SpecialEdition-Dark/large/inthehandsoftheempire.gif" width="265" height="371" /> 

Bringing this objective back has been a real challenge though, because of balance concerns and new guidelines we have in place. I&#8217;ll go over this with you here so you understand why we still haven&#8217;t seen this back in the game yet.

The first (and obvious) part to look for is Ounee Ta.

<img class="wp-image-3796 alignnone" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/r3ouneetal-214x300.png" alt="" width="265" height="371" /><img class="wp-image-2776 alignnone" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/jpsdouneetal-214x300.png" alt="" width="265" height="371" /> 

This card (whichever version you use) is a thorn in the side of ROPS. The deploy bonus, on one hand, negates the ROPS objective deploy +2 to Rebels. But the effect version also lets your vehicles and non-Rebel characters deploy -3, so heavy hitters like Anakin (2), Rey (1), Yoda (2) and others will invade in a hurry. On top of that, the LS gets a massive boost in generation, so if you want to flip ROPS with the original <> sites, you&#8217;ll be giving up at least 6 Force to the opponent &#8212; which is a complete non-starter in the game these days.

Conclusion from Ounee Ta: Whatever we make has to be immune to this, either by explicitly stating that, or by making unique Ralltiir sites. Historically, we have always made Effects that state &#8220;Ralltiir sites are immune to Ounee Ta,&#8221; but we don&#8217;t want to do that here because we don&#8217;t want to force the ROPS player to start that effect, leaving him with only 2 effects to get creative in deckbuilding. We also don&#8217;t want to put the text on a virtual Ralltiir system, as one of the lessons we learned from legacy is that we shouldn&#8217;t have game text on locations affecting the game play at other locations (ie, global text on a location).

So that leaves us with making unique sites on Ralltiir, which is a pretty good option. We can make each site unique (no pun intended) that adds something to the deck that it didn&#8217;t have before. Here are some of the actual texts we sent to playtesting in the past 6-8 months (note that these are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> spoilers, and will not be released in this form):

Ralltiir (V)  
Dark (2): Devastator is deploy -2 here and is hyperspeed +1 moving to or from here.  
Light (0): Tantive IV is power +1 here and hyperspeed +1 moving to or from here.  
[Planet]  
[Parsec 3]

Ralltiir: Grallia Spaceport  
Dark (2): If you control, at same and related locations your Imperials are power +1.  
Light (1): If you control, at same and related locations your Rebels are power +1.  
\[Planet\] \[Scomp Link\] [Exterior]

Ralltiir: Grallia Financial District  
Dark (2): Your characters may move for free between here and Grallia Spaceport.  
Light (1): Rebels are power +1 here.  
\[Planet\] \[Exterior\]

So there is a 2/0 Ralltiir system to make the starting activation ratio somewhat more in line with today&#8217;s game, and some sites with rather vanilla (but somewhat familiar) text. We sent these (along with a few other related cards) to playtesting to see how it did, and the initial reaction from the playtesting team was excitement &#8212; they WANTED to play with ROPS. It was like watching kids open their presents on Christmas morning.

Unfortunately, with all of the games where ROPS was tested, it didn&#8217;t win a single game. It lost to WHAP, HB, WYS, Diplo, QMC. It just really struggled, and we were a little surprised. We made some adjustments and tried sites like these to speed it up and increase its damage potential:

Ralltiir: Grallia Spaceport  
Dark (2): Force drain +1 here if you occupy a related docking bay.  
Light (1): Force drain -1 here unless you control a related docking bay.

Ralltiir: High Ontis  
Dark (2): Imperials deploy -1 here and draw battle destiny here if unable to otherwise.  
Light (1): Your force drains are -1 here and may not be further modified by opponent.

Still pretty much the same result. We were up against the clock, and couldn&#8217;t reach a consensus on how to release the cards, so we held them back. It&#8217;s very difficult to strike a balance, as when ROPS was around it was very often close to Tier 1. At the time, DS was already rather strong, and we didn&#8217;t want to risk making it that much better. We could have released some Ralltiir locations piecemeal and slowly reintroduced it, but we didn&#8217;t want to hem ourselves in for the future, since we didn&#8217;t have the full vision ready (this is another lesson learned from the reset, as I&#8217;m sure many of you remember the &#8220;Death Star Schematics&#8221; reference).

Which brings us to today, when we are still working on the details of ROPS. I wouldn&#8217;t expect to see this in the March release, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it makes an appearance in 2017.

If you have strong opinions on ROPS (as most people do!), start the discussion for how you would like to see it come back in the on the forums!
