Hi everyone,

This fortnight, I had the pleasure of interviewing Tom Haid, the 2016 Star Wars CCG World Champion. I talked to him about his first SWCCG experiences, his preparation for Worlds, and what it’s like to play on the game’s biggest stage. Tom is a great guy, a close friend of mine, and a great ambassador for SWCCG. Without further ado…

**NARP Fortnightly: How did you get your start playing competitive SWCCG?**

Tom Haid: A gentleman named Emerson Sklar walked into my hobby shop in 2011 not too long after I opened it, and at some point we got to talking about Star Wars CCG. I had a few cards as a kid back in the day but I never understood how to play the game. I was absolutely fascinated to learn about how the PC kept the game alive and kept it going. After truly learning how the game works, I was pretty blown away. There are some ingenious mechanics to this game that I find artful in their creation and execution.

**NF: What steps did you take to improve at the game?**

TH: I suppose the two main things are:

  1. Keep thinking about new strategies and new ideas and try them out on the tabletop against good decks
  2. Play with the good decks, even if it’s not your style. Play with them to understand them and to understand why the top players put certain cards into those decks. Play with them to discover ways you could incorporate pieces from them into your own deck ideas, and pieces from your own deck ideas into them.

**NF: What do you think has been most helpful to your growth as a player?**

TH: Having friends to bounce ideas off of &#x1f642;

**NF: What were the top decks you expected to see at Worlds?**

TH: I expected to see less [TTO](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/thatthingsoperational.gif) because of [Escape Pod combo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/escapepodweredoomed.gif) and [Old Allies](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/oldallies.gif), even though I chose to jump past that and play TTO myself. I also expected plenty of [Court](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/courtofthevilegangster.gif), which seemed to hold a playable matchup against most of the LS field except for [TRM](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/yavin4massassithroneroom.gif) and maybe [TIGIH](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/thereisgoodinhim.gif), though I still figured we would see very little TIGIH. I was hoping we would see some OA, but I assumed there wouldn&#8217;t be much of it; from what I was seeing in playtest experiences between us and especially for Steve [Skilton], it felt like it wasn&#8217;t going to be able to live up to the expectations we had for it, and I figured other players would realize this as well.

**NF: When building your own decks, did you try to design something to beat the meta, or did you just play something you were comfortable with?**

TH: I definitely do both, though when I&#8217;m building a deck I&#8217;m thinking less about beating other decks and more about at least having a game plan against them. I don&#8217;t like the idea of playing a deck that will likely lose to any semi-common deck in the meta, but sometimes that&#8217;s unavoidable, which I felt was very much the case for Dark Side this time around. My hope was that I would arrive at two decks I love and that I would be able to play them again and again so that I know them well. I only achieved this half-way and found that with [QMC](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Light/quietminingcolony.gif) for LS, but kept struggling to land on a decision for DS.

**NF: What specific &#8220;tech&#8221; cards did you include? What weaknesses did you perceive in the top decks, and did you do anything to take advantage of those weaknesses?**

TH: I love me some tech cards. Most of my teching was done in my QMC, or as I like to refer to it, QMSizzle, and I wanted cards that would help me in a variety of matches. The most difficult choice I had was what to include to help with Court, which, in testing, was usually a pretty difficult match for me. I really dislike the idea of adding cards that serve only one narrow purpose, but adding [A Gift](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Light/agift.gif) was one of the few exceptions I made to that personal rule. It is just so useful in that match, [Harc Seff](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/harcseff.gif) can pull it with his gametext, and in all other matches it&#8217;s a pullable floating 4 that I can 3PO back or pitch to a drain. Beyond that, I wanted a handful of cards that could help with [IE](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/imperialentanglements.gif) and other DS vehicle matches so I went with [Chewie with Bowcaster](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/chewiewithbowcaster.gif) as my Chewie of choice and added [Captain Yutani with Blaster Cannon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/captainyutaniwithblastercannon.gif) (that guy is a beast). I additionally like [Sense](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/sense.gif) for that scenario because you can stop their reacting AT-ST at a critical moment. When I progressed on to Day 3, I wanted to fit even more tech cards and finally found a way to fit [Landing Claw](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Dagobah-Light/landingclaw.gif) into the deck, which I have been wanting to do for a while (and, really, I wanted to have at least one weapon/device to &#8220;retrieve&#8221; loop with [Yoxgit](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Light/yoxgit.gif)); I knew Landing Claw would do some good work versus IE, and it performed remarkably. On top of that, I added [Inconsequential Barriers](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Light/inconsequentialbarriers.gif), for two reasons: I wanted a way to stop [Imperial Barrier](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/imperialbarrier.gif) in case I needed to make a play of [Beldon&#8217;s Eye](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/beldonseye.gif)&#8216;ing for Harc & [Overseer](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/overseer.gif) to [Bespin](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/bespin.gif), flip, pull the [DB](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/cloudcityplatform327dockingbay.gif), land, and consolidate at the [1/0](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/cloudcityupperplazacorridor.gif) all in one turn, and an untimely Imperial Barrier would be a real pain there. The other reason was to stop [Control & Set For Stun](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/control&setforstun.gif), which is excellent versus my low-ability character package and also helps DS with the SAC war.

**NF: You&#8217;ve become known for playing innovative decks with unexpected card choices. What is it about this style of play that appeals to you?**

TH: I think about this game A LOT; I have a great deal of passion for it, and the way I often go about thinking about this game is by trying to view the same situation from as many different angles as I can, which often arrives me at some unorthodox strategies. To accompany that mentality, I often approach this game in a puzzle-solving mentality, where when I arrive at an idea or a card I want to make work, I default to thinking, &#8220;there IS a way to do this,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t give up on that thought until I feel I&#8217;ve completely exhausted all options and considerations. An unfortunate side effect of allowing my brain to operate this way is that when I do fail to find a solution in such a scenario, I am left feeling unfulfilled and have a hard time letting go of it; my mind will wander back to trying to figure it out all over again, revisiting all previous attempts, seeing if I missed something. Putting strategies discovered this way to the test can be really arduous, and as such, if I am able to pull them off successfully, it is a very rewarding feeling. Like cracking an ancient code and then using it to discover buried treasure. I LOVE that this game can do that for me again and again.

**NF: What are your thoughts on Set 4? What are some of your favorite cards from the newest set?**

TH: I am a huge fan of Set 4, and I am really pleased that the PC capitalized on Episode 7 by including cards for it in the set. I truly enjoy playing [Rey](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/rey.gif), though I do see her as pretty powerful. She is such a fun card to use. I also really, really want to find a way to make [Bow to the First Order](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/bowtothefirstorder.gif) work. The [flip Falcon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/thefalconjunkyardgarbage.gif) idea is super awesome, and there are several excellent arts. I do have a few concerns, but I feel like they are concerns that can still easily be addressed later down the road. Mostly, I am worried about TTO. I feel like we have tried to keep that deck in check with probably too many direct and indirect counters, yet at the same time, we did not succeed at that attempt, and TTO is still a very healthy deck; heck, I played it at Worlds for that exact reason. I don&#8217;t think TTO is too good, but I do think that we could have handled it a little better. I&#8217;m not a fan of Escape Pod & We&#8217;re Doomed. Overall, I think Set 4 is a smashing success, and it has many sleeper cards that will improve greatly with the release of future sets. I really look forward to seeing if [BB-8](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/bb8.gif) gets better. He could become such a juicy target for [Program Trap](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Dark/programtrap.gif)!

**NF: Is there a particular game from the weekend that you&#8217;re most proud of?**

TH: Finals, my QMSizzle versus Reid [Smith]&#8217;s IE. I think it is my best game I have ever played with QMC. Somehow, under all that pressure, a kind of pressure I had never quite experienced before with dozens of folks crowded around us, eyes on me, twitch camera streaming, many people counting on me and expecting me to do my best, I managed to play my absolute best. I am still not quite sure where it came from; I was the kid in high school who was so nervous to give a speech that his legs would shake uncontrollably, yet in that match and in many of those moments, I was able to find absolute confidence in what I was doing. The only thing I needed to keep telling myself in my mind during that match was, &#8220;don&#8217;t forget to re-attach Landing Claw! Don&#8217;t forget to re-attach Landing Claw!&#8221;. After the first few turns, everything else- all the options in my huge hand, all the different avenues of attack I could explore, all the counter strategies and counter counter strategies, they were all crystal clear in my mind. I truly hope that I can be that version of me more often!

**NF: Is there a loss that you learned a lot from? Did your tactics adjust as the weekend went on?**

TH: Aaaaabsolutley. First match of the Top 8, QMSizzle versus Tom Kelly&#8217;s IE. I made a pretty big mistake putting out the Docking Bay, giving him an easy in to establishing presence on Cloud City (and on top of that, I foolishly left Yoxgit unprotected at the DB, but that&#8217;s another mistake entirely). I immediately learned from this error and I made absolutely certain to not put out the DB early versus Reid in our Final match of QMSizzle versus IE.

**NF: You lost Game 1 of the semifinals by 20. What was going through your head before and during Game 2?** 

TH: I felt like a fool during and after Game 1. I let the pressure get to me and I made two bad mistakes: forgetting to put out [Emperor&#8217;s Power](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/emperorspower.gif) early and misinterpreting [I&#8217;ll Try Spinning](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Light/illtryspinning.gif) (though at that point the game was already pretty much over). I was playing a deck (and an objective) I had never played before for DS, and in hindsight, that was probably too risky of a call for Top 8. The adage we use of &#8220;play what you know&#8221; was exemplified rather perfectly here, and continued to do so into our next match, because as soon as I felt QMSizzle back in my hands, I was a different person. I was confident again and I was, for lack of a better term, happy, despite having just botched a VERY important game.

**NF: Game 1 of the finals was versus Imperial Entanglements, a matchup that you lost by 14 earlier that day. What adjustments did you make to pull off a win by 29?**

TH: As stated earlier, the main adjustment I made was to not put out the Docking Bay. Tom Kelly&#8217;s opening hand of setting up eeeeverything Turn 1 was pretty incredible, and thankfully Reid did not also get the perfect hand to pull that off, and from that point forward I tried to play a bit more psychologically than pragmatically. I wanted Reid to play defensively in space and carelessly on ground; I tried to enforce this mentality by drawing up a bunch of cards to both present the potential threat of what I could throw at him in space on the [Home One](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/homeone.gif) and to incentivize him to spread on ground to capitalize on damage and me not being able to find my cards to flip fast enough (I was also hoping Reid would assume my ground for QMC was more like it normally is, rather than EPP Chewie, EPP Yutani and some other heavy hitters with a Sense backup for the AT-ST react).

**NF: What did it feel like after you won? Was there a particular moment from the aftermath that stuck out?**

TH: Complete disbelief. At one point, when I was still at the table I played the finals on, someone said something very simple to me, I think it was Rob asking me about which banner I wanted to take home, the one full of everyone&#8217;s signatures (YES) or the other, and I suddenly had a hard time holding back a few tears. It was pretty emotional for me. It is something I have been POURING myself into, and yet I did not think I would be able to earn a World Champion title, or even come closer to it than the first round of a Top 8, for a long time. There are so many remarkably skilled players in this game, and this game can get so incredibly difficult and intense in such a marvelous way.

My favorite moment that stuck out to me the most from the aftermath is when a slightly-drunk Tom Kelly gave me a hug in my hotel room after exchanging some very heartwarming words with me. So many people have said such wonderful things to me. I have made friends in this community that are better friends to me than most friends I have had in my life. It is such an honor to know so many of you and to become a part of this community. I have felt like a bit of an outsider since I started playing this game competitively in 2011, knowing I am often playing against people who have been playing this game for at least a decade more than that, but now I feel more happy in this community than I have in any other.

**NF: Thanks for talking to us, and congrats again on the win.**

TH: Thanks for being you, Lenny. Thanks for being an awesome friend, and awesome playtest partner, and an awesome part of this community. I think it&#8217;s really wonderful that you have created the NARP Fortnightly and continue to write for it; thanks for letting me be a part of it!

**NF: That’s it for this fortnight. Until next time…**

TH: …Peace, Love, and High Destinies!
