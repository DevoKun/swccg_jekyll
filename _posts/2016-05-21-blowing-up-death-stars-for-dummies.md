With all of the ominous rumors about the Empire building a second dreaded Death Star, now might be a good time to ensure your militia is armed with the knowledge about how to blow it up before that thing’s operational.

### _&#8220;Sounds Dangerous&#8221;_

Especially in the current meta, the “build the Death Star II” deck (commonly called “TTO,” an anagram for the Epic Event the deck uses<img class="size-medium wp-image-1790 alignleft" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/ds2thatthingsoperationald-214x300.png" alt="ds2thatthingsoperationald.png" width="214" height="300" />) can be a strong option for the Dark Side by setting up turns of massive direct damage. Once the damage gets rolling, the Light Side player has a choice: if he is considerably far ahead in the game, he can continue to “damage race” the Dark Side; however if he is not, he will need some way to deal with all of the different ways the Dark Side is causing Force loss during their control phase.

Since the Epic Event itself allows for the Light Side to blow up the Death Star II, that is always one option available to you. And as per the Epic Event, if the Death Star II is blown away, the Dark Side player loses “double Force” – which means that with the Death Star II and all three sectors on table, the Dark Side player would have to lose 20 Force (24 Force if they also played the Death Star II: Docking Bay!). But as enticing as that sounds, it’s not as easy as it might look.

First, you have to get there &#8211; with a starfighter _(note: only starfighters can go in to the sectors)._ 

Also, since the Death Star II system has no Light Side Force icons, you’ll have to either deploy to the system it is orbiting (keep in mind that’s +1 if it’s at the [Endor system](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Endor-Dark/endor.gif)) and then move over to the Death Star II, or you’ll have to use some sort of trick. For example, you could deploy a spy pilot like [Corran Horn](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Light/corranhorn.gif) there simultaneously with an unpiloted starfighter, you could use [Fly Casual](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Endor-Light/flycasual.gif), or you could deploy _Tantive IV_ there to create presence for your starfighter to deploy). Another trick would be to play a ship there and use a card like [Hyper Escape](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/hyperescape.gif) – if the Dark Side tries to battle your ship away, you can move away to the Death Star II system (or into the first sector) and basically move in one turn faster than you normally could.

### _&#8220;Fighters Fly Into The Superstructure&#8230;&#8221;_

<img class="size-medium wp-image-8874 aligncenter" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/DSII-set-up-300x109.png" alt="DSII set up" width="300" height="109" /> 

So once your starfighter is at the Death Star II system, it can move from the system into the Coolant Shaft sector for 1 Force as a regular move.

Once your ship is inside the sectors, remember these important sector rules:

  * Neither player may deploy, battle or initiate a Force drain at a Death Star II sector
  * Starfighters may move to Death Star II sectors, but squadrons and capital starships cannot (even if it moves like a starfighter)
  * Dark Side starfighters can only move to a Death Star II sector if there is a Light Side starfighter at a sector (if there is not one, then the Dark Side ships must move back towards the system during the Dark Side player’s move phase, for free, one sector per turn).
  * Moving from sector to sector (or system to sector or sector to system) is otherwise a regular move that costs 1 Force (unless it is &#8220;escaping&#8221; from the Death Star II after you blow it up)

As you move from sector to sector, you must draw movement destiny as indicated on the specific sector cards. Note that cards that modify movement destiny (e.g. [Desperate Counter](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/desperatecounter.gif)) affect the total of the draw and the maneuver.

### _&#8220;&#8230;Attempt to Knock Out the Main Reactor.&#8221;_

So, before you wonder who they found to pull that off, keep in mind some simple math and realize how high of a destiny you will need to draw in order to blow away the Death Star II _before_ making a resource commitment to doing such.

You need > 8 to blow it, but will always have the following modifiers:[<img class="alignright wp-image-4214 " src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/tatweshalldoubleoureffortsd-214x300.png" alt="tatweshalldoubleoureffortsd.png" width="135" height="188" />](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Tatooine-Dark/weshalldoubleourefforts.gif)

  1. The pilot’s ability.
  2. +1 for each starfighter at the Reactor Core (so you will always have +1 to your draw at least, since you must have 1 starfighter there in order to attempt the blow)

However, you should also make sure to account for [We Shall Double Our Efforts](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Tatooine-Dark/weshalldoubleourefforts.gif) (which subtracts 2 from the attempt) as every TTO deck is going to include that card. So even if it is not on the table at the time you start your movement towards the Reactor Core, you should plan for it to be there by the time you get there.

*Note: [General Calrissian](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/generalcalrissian.gif) acts as a 5 only if [he is the pilot you chose to make the attempt](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=60228&).  
^Note: Han, Chewie, And The _Falcon_ uses [3 for Han&#8217;s ability](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=58294&).

Additionally, you should try to make sure to draw at least one higher than what you need to blow it because [A Dark Time For The Rebellion (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/adarktimefortherebellion.gif) can subtract 1 and make what you had assumed would be a successful draw into a failure (ie a wasted turn by you and another turn of damage for them). So, whenever deciding whether or not you should try to blow it up, just be wary that if you are going with a low-ability pilot, you may have to draw a destiny a bit higher than what you can calculate is on table.

To counter these, you can always fly multiple starfighters in (each will add one to your attempt – however remember, each much then draw a movement destiny to escape, so especially late game, you may run out of destinies to draw, meaning the draw fails and your ship explodes along with the Emperor’s vision for a unified galaxy) or pack some torpedoes or missiles (since that will add 3 to your attempt as per the game text of the Epic Event). So using a card like [Intruder Missile](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Light/intrudermissile.gif) (which is a destiny 7) is an option in a TTO-heavy meta if you are including Han, Chewie And The _Falcon_ anyway and want a slight boost to your chances of blowing it away.

### _&#8220;They Did It!&#8221;_

Now that you’ve blown away the battle station, your ships will have to hurry up and try to get out of the exploding death ball. Your starfighters at the Reactor Core move (one at a time, as a free and unlimited move) to the Capacitors, and then to the Coolant Shaft, and then to the system. With each movement, you must draw movement destiny as described above.

All of the Light Side ships move from the Reactor Core to the Capacitors first, then the Dark Side ships. Then all of the Light Side ships move from the Capacitors to the Coolant Shaft, then the Dark Side ships. Then all of the Light Side ships move from the Coolant Shaft to the system, then the Dark Side ships.

### _“It’s a Trap!!!”_

Be wary of cards like A Dark Time For The Rebellion (V) – a clever Dark Side player can hold on to it to subtract one from that well tracked destiny, causing your attempt to blow it away to fail. Or, even worse, if you draw low for your movement destiny referenced on the sectors, A Dark Time For The Rebellion (V) might just blow your whole ship up!

[Ommni Box & It’s Worse](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/ommnibox&itsworse.gif): this card can mess up your tracking at the worst possible time and TTO decks are likely to pack this card anyway to ensure It Could Be Worse doesn’t mitigate their damage.

Cards that can remove your pilot (such as [Control & Set For Stun](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/control&setforstun.gif) or even [Come With Me](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Dark/comewithme.gif) for Obi-Wan In _Radiant VII_) or prevent you from moving (such as Imperial Barrier or [Forced Landing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/forcedlanding.gif)) can prevent you from deploying to the system the Death Star II is orbiting and then moving over to the Death Star II system on the same turn. This has the obvious effect of slowing down your attempt to blow the Death Star II by one full turn since you have to wait an additional turn before even moving into the sectors. But it also gives the Dark Side an extra turn to deploy in front of your ship and battle it away.

### _A Critical Error&#8230;_

So, if you&#8217;re going up against a TTO deck, what should your plan be? That depends. TTO can set up damage quickly, but attempting to blow up the Death Star II is not always the best course of action. It will generally require a commitment of certain resources:

  * Deploying a starfighter/pilot combination with ability of 4 of better (anything less may require you to draw a destiny of 8)
  * Devoting that resource to locations where you cannot battle or drain for four turns (assuming you deploy your ship to the system it is orbiting and move it over to the Death Star II system for one turn, and then the next three turns moving in to the sectors)
  * Ensuring you can draw a 5, 6, or 7 destiny to blow it away (depending on if you are using Obi-Wan or Corran, and being mindful of Ommni Box & It’s Worse and A Dark Time For The Rebellion (V) being used to thwart your efforts).

If you can meet all of those conditions (being sure to not discount the “opportunity cost” that the second point is!), then the payoff is usually pretty good – dealing (at least) 20 Force loss! Otherwise, it might be better for those Bothans to die looking for another way to deal with the damage.
