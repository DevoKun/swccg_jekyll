Greetings Star Wars players!

You all showed incredible enthusiasm at the announcement of the Vader’s Custom TIE design contest &#8211; much more than even we anticipated! Thank you to everyone who submitted their idea. In total, we received 66 entries (in honor of the Jedi who died due to Order 66).

The voting from design and development has been tallied, but we&#8217;re going to make you wait for the announcement of the 4 finalists. Instead, I&#8217;m going to share with you the Honorable Mentions &#8211; from 5th to 10th place (still a remarkable achievement considering the large field!). The top 4 will be posted tomorrow, with instructions on how to vote and determine which concept will be developed and playtested to become the first virtual Vader’s Custom TIE in the entire Star Wars CCG PC era.

Because of the overwhelming response, we have decided to reward each of these Honorable Mentions with $5 store credit to the PC store.

May add 1 pilot. Vader deploys -3 aboard. While piloted by Vader at a battleground: maneuver +2, power may not be reduced and during your control phase may take into hand one Watch Your Back or opponent loses 1 force.

From: Tarriel &#8211; Peter Rowlands

May add Vader as pilot, deploys -3. While alone his battle destinies cannot be cancelled, opponent cannot draw more than one and their weapon destiny draws are -2 here. Immune to Attrition <6.

From: Pantherpike &#8211; Phillip Gladney

May add 1 pilot.  
While piloted by Vader, once per turn may upload a Black Squadron Pilot and your Black Squadron TIE&#8217;s here are power and maneuver +1. Immune to attrition <5.

From: boshek1 &#8211; Scott Morgan

May add 1 pilot. Vader deploys -2 aboard. While Vader piloting maneuver +2 and adds a destiny to power. Once during your deploy phase may upload a Black Squadron Tie. Immune to attrition < 3.

From: scifisubi &#8211; Steve Kotson

May add Vader as pilot. Vader deploys -3 aboard and adds one battle destiny while he is aboard.  During your control phase rather than force draining here may return this tie and all cards on it to owner&#8217;s hand.

From: brainschrat &#8211; Jordi Paul

May add Vader as a pilot. In battle, may use the ability number of an opponent’s pilot instead of drawing destiny here. Immune to attrition < 5.

Congratulations to these entrants! Check back tomorrow for the announcement of the 4 finalists.

Happy Holidays and May The Force Be With You!
