From testing out Death Stars, to the rebel insurgency on Scarif, see what Set 9 has in store for you!  
The set is mainly containing the Rogue One themes, but also features Episode VIII cards, clones and generals, and the controversial female Indiana Jones of the Star Wars Universe&#8230; Doctor Aphra.

The full set can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/virtual/Set-9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.starwarsccg.org/virtual/Set-9.pdf</a>

We have already updated the pictures on Holotable and are working on Gemp and High Rez scans now.

May the Force be with you!
