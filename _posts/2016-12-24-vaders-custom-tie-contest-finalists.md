Hello again Star Wars players!

It&#8217;s time to announce the four finalists for the Vader’s Custom TIE Contest! Thank you again to everyone who entered or shared information about the contest.

My favorite piece of trivia stemming from this is that we actually had an original designer of the game, who worked for Decipher, submit an idea! It&#8217;s great to see familiar names like that still around.

I speak for the other judges in saying this was extremely difficult to narrow down to 4. There were so many thematic, unique concepts that just barely missed the cut. At the same time, I was rather surprised at how many similar concepts were submitted as well.

Each of these four finalists will also be awarded $10 store credit to the PC store regardless of who wins.

To vote, send a private message on the forums to Rules Advocate Tim Simon at &#8220;Aglets,&#8221; with the option number you wish to vote for in the subject line, **in this format exactly**:

Vader&#8217;s Custom TIE Contest &#8212; Option 1

It is very important that you have this information only in the subject line &#8211; otherwise <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your vote will not be counted</span>. You may only vote once, and you have until Friday, January 6th at 5pm ET to vote. Votes submitted after that time will not be counted.

The winner will be announced live at the Match Play Championship on Saturday, January 7th.

Without further ado, here are your four finalists! (If one of these is yours, please refrain from publicly claiming it the interest of everyone voting for the best concept)

**Option 1**  
May add 1 pilot. While with your TIE, may not be targeted by opponent&#8217;s weapons. If piloted by Vader, immune to attrition < 5, and, during battle, may cancel game text of opponent’s pilot character here.

**Option 2**  
May add 1 pilot. Deploys free if Death Star system on table. While Vader piloting, once per battle, may reduce power of opponent&#8217;s starship here by this starship’s maneuver. Immune to attrition < 4.

**Option 3**  
May add Vader as pilot. Black Squadron TIEs may deploy here as a ‘react’. During battle you may cause another TIE present to be ‘hit’ to cancel one just drawn destiny or ‘react’. Immune to attrition <5.

**Option 4**  
May add 1 pilot. Unless present with your starship, adds one battle destiny. Once per turn, Vader may cancel the game text of a pilot aboard a starfighter (except Falcon) here. Immune to attrition < 5.  
Thank you all again! We look forward to announcing the winner at the MPC!

Happy Holidays and May The Force Be With You!
