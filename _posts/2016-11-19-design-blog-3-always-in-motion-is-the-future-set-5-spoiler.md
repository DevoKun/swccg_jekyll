Greetings Star Wars CCG Players!

As you have seen, it&#8217;s been a very busy week for us. Earlier this week we announced the errata to the starting effects, as well as a few First Order trooper cards. But I&#8217;m here today to talk about Set 5, a player card set to be released one week from today.

This week has been quite a roller coaster for the D&D teams. So much so that this is actually my 3rd draft of a design blog to share you with you all. Things change fast around here, as they say. Or more appropriately: always in motion is the future.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3598" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/r2senseuncertainisthefutured-214x300.png" alt="r2senseuncertainisthefutured.png" width="214" height="300" /> 

I originally was going to share with you all some behind the scenes access to some of the cards that were cut from Set 5. That blog post will have to wait for another day. The second draft of this blog was explaining in detail how two player cards from this set were cut at the last hour (despite the fact that I really liked these cards, I&#8217;m a bit disappointed because this second blog draft was probably my favorite!). This third (and hopefully final) draft is being written at a time when those two cards are now back in this set, because they were deemed too important for the meta to pass up.

I have to take time out of this blog to just say that those involved with this specific decision &#8212; namely the developers and the player creators &#8212; handled it in such a way that makes me very proud, and leaves me very confident in the prospects of this game&#8217;s long term future. While nobody likes it when their card doesn&#8217;t get released, both of these player creators reassured me that it was all right. They wanted what is best for the game, and if the developers thought it was the right decision, they supported it. The developers worked literally around the clock this week to decide what the best course of action was to help the current meta. This was my biggest take away from the process of Set 5: that so many hard working volunteers can take a step back from a difficult situation and honestly say that no matter how much a decision might hurt, they support it if it&#8217;s best for the game. So thank you to those player creators and the development team for always keeping this game first, and for handling this situation so professionally.

I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the player cards in this set. It might be the best group of player cards to come out in one set since I have been on Design. See for yourselves &#8212; below is the full spoiler list of Set 5 cards. I would be remiss to not mention that all of the below cards are subject to change before their final, expected release date of Friday, November 25th &#8212; as we all know, always in motion is the future.

May The Force Be With You,
