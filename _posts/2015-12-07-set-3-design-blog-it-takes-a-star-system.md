At long last, Set 3 is officially released! We apologize for the delay, but please know that we were working hard this past weekend behind the scenes to make sure the set was perfect and ready to go for you all to enjoy. We read lots of good feedback since the spoiler was posted, and were able to incorporate some of the suggestions given to make this set even better.

I first of all want to thank all of the people that worked on this set the past few months. Brad, Jarad, Ryan, and Seth from Design, Emil, Justin, Matt, and Tom from Development, too many playtesters to name, Jeremy and the Graphics Design team (you all are going to love the work they did this set as usual!), Tim and Greg from the rules team, all of the proofing team, and of course all of the Advocates, who gave suggestions and shared wisdom on the process the past few months.

Most of all, I want to thank all of the players. I was fortunate enough to be chosen by the Advocates to lead the Design team this set, and that is something that means a great deal to me. Without the strong community we have, I would not have had this opportunity that many of us have desired since the time we opened our first pack. I hope you all enjoy the new cards immensely, and continue to grow the game in your communities.

That said, I am excited to pass the torch to the next leader of the Design team and continue to create new, exciting designs that keep this wonderful game moving forward.

I hope to see you at the MPC! Now, onto Set 4!
