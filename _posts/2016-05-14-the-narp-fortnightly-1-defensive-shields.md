Hi everyone,

Welcome to the first in a series of articles for NARPs. (That’s “new and returning players.” You can get caught up on Star Wars CCG’s alphabet soup [here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=188&t=60804).) No matter how long you’ve been gone, or even if you’re picking up the game for the first time, we’re here to help you get up to speed. Welcome (back) to Star Wars CCG! We’re going to start with probably the biggest hurdle for new players: Defensive Shields.

At the start of the game, in addition to your normal starting location (or objective), starting interrupt, and all the cards they allow you to deploy, you also get to deploy a starting effect. The original starting effects were Fear Is My Ally and An Unusual Amount Of Fear, but the Players Committee has given us [Knowledge And Defense (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/knowledgeanddefense.gif) and [Anger, Fear, Aggression (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/angerfearaggression.gif), which let you use more shields, so they are the ones everyone uses (and you should too). It’s the first card of every 60-card deck; only 59 to go!

These starting effects let you put 15 cards underneath them, which don’t count toward your deck limit. Four times per game, you can play a defensive shield from under your starting effect. Those shields then stay on the table for the rest of the game.

A lot of players shy away from these teal-colored beauties. “It’s hard enough to keep track of my 60-card deck, now you want to make it 75? And I have to keep track of those other 15 and pick the right ones to play at the right time?” Yes, playing with shields can be a bit daunting at first. But I encourage you to think of them not as cards, but as “rules of the game.”

A good example is Battle Plan and its counterpart, Battle Order. You might be familiar with these cards from the Endor set. The defensive shield versions work the same way, but you can put them on the table (as a top-level action) whenever you want. In practice, that means your opponent will almost always play Battle Plan/Battle Order if doing so will slow down your deck. So, when building a deck, you have to assume Battle Plan/Battle Order will be on the table: you either need to play in both theaters (ground and space) or be prepared to use 3 Force to Force drain. By keeping that “rule” in your head, you will become a better player and deckbuilder.

So, what are the different shields, and which ones should you use? Here’s are my thoughts. (I encourage you to follow along with the cards [here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/card-list/) as you read through this list.)

**<u>Light Side</u>**

_The Force Will Be with You… Always:_

**[A Tragedy Has Occurred](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/atragedyhasoccurred.gif) –** This hits the table in just about every game. Grabbing your opponent’s key interrupt so they can’t recycle it and have to pay extra for future copies, is great. And you don’t even have to devote a deck slot to it, because it’s a shield.  
**[Aim High](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/aimhigh.gif) –** Needing to pay for retrieval is practically a rule of the game at this point. Decks that retrieve a lot are built on the assumption that they will need to pay for it. If your opponent deploys a card that can retrieve force, this shield is all but mandatory. Obviously, if your deck starts the effect version (or the Insurrection & Aim High combo effect), you don’t need the shield.  
**[Battle Plan](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/battleplan.gif) –** This should be under every starting effect. As discussed above, it’s practically a rule of the game. You don’t need this if you start the Battle Plan & Draw Their Fire combo effect.  
**[Goldenrod](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/goldenrod.gif) –** Pretty much its only use is to make them pay 2 Force to pull a guy with Blizzard 4. That can be pretty good, especially if it delays them by a turn. It also makes the Executor deploy for 2 (instead of free) with They Must Never Again Leave This City. Goldenrod&#8217;s existence also stops ISB Sunsdown from being a deck.  
**[Simple Tricks And Nonsense](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/simpletricksandnonsense.gif) –** Worth playing to discourage them from taking over your 2/0 sites with spies; doing so will be pointless unless they also occupy two battlegrounds (or you don’t occupy any). If Simple Tricks stops them from draining at a site for a turn, or stops retrieval for a turn, it’s often worth the price of a shield.  
**[The Republic No Longer Functions](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/therepublicnolongerfunctions.gif) –** In addition to its obvious utility against Senate decks, this also stops annoying cards like Scanning Crew and M’iiyoom Onith.  
**[Ultimatum](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/ultimatum.gif) –** This should almost always make the cut. Depending on the matchup, you may or may not be at three battlegrounds, and your opponent may or may not be draining for 3+ at one location, but with lightsabers, Presence Of The Force, etc., it happens more often than you’d expect. As with Simple Tricks, stopping one or two points of damage is usually worth the price of a shield. We Have A Plan can probably get away with skipping this one, because the objective does the same thing while flipped (and that deck is unlikely to be at three battlegrounds when not flipped).  
**[Weapons Display (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/weaponsdisplay.gif) –** This is probably the hardest shield to wrap your head around. The first function makes them lose Force when they exclude someone from a battle—with Stunning Leader, You Are Beaten, Force Push (V), or even when they Imperial Barrier your character but your other characters initiate battle anyway. The second function rewards you (and punishes your opponent) if you’re in both theaters and they deploy without battling. Any deck that plays any amount of ground needs this card. Hidden Base can probably get away with skipping it.  
**[Your Insight Serves You Well (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/yourinsightservesyouwell.gif) –** The main reason to include this is so you don’t auto-lose to Podracing. Scanning Crew and inserts are abusive but are rarely seen.

_I’m Getting Pretty Good at This:_

**[Affect Mind (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/affectmind.gif) –** If your game plan against Combat is to battle at their sites, then you need this. If your plan is to win the game by damage racing, it’s not important.  
**[Do, Or Do Not](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/doordonot.gif) –** This falls into the “often, but not always” category. If you’re not playing your own Sense and Alter cards, playing this is a no-brainer. If you are playing your own, then you probably don’t want to put this on the table until late in the game when your copies are all lost (if you play it at all). Watch Your Step can probably get away with skipping this one; the objective prevents Sense and Alter from being played as long as it stays flipped (but note that Alter (V) gets around the objective’s limitation).  
**Jabba’s Prize (V) –** Not technically a shield, but you need it if your deck relies on a Han other than Han, Chewie, And The Falcon (e.g., Watch Your Step, Rebel Strike Team, many builds of Quiet Mining Colony and Diplomatic Mission To Alderaan).  
**[Only Jedi Carry That Weapon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/onlyjedicarrythatweapon.gif) –** If you’re playing with matching lightsabers, you need this shield to stop Weapon Levitation. Otherwise, skip it.  
**[Wise Advice](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/wiseadvice.gif) –** This is the Sense/Alter shield you should use if you want to also play your own Senses and Alters. Do, Or Do Not punishes both players; Wise Advice isn’t quite as strong, but it only helps you. If your deck relies on a key effect that isn’t immune to Alter, such as Echo Base Garrison, Crash Site Memorial, or I Hope She’s All Right, this is a must.

_It Could Be Worse:_

**[Don&#8217;t Do That Again (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/dontdothatagain.gif) –** Right now, the only commonly-played deck that uses Mobilization Points is Imperial Entanglements, and that deck starts the game occupying a battleground system, so this is currently not that important (as of May 2016). But other decks sometimes arise that use Mobilization Points, so it’s a good card to keep in mind. Protection from Always Thinking With Your Stomach is good, but you need to have the foresight to play it before they play the interrupt. Pulling an immediate effect once per game can be handy even if you don’t have any immediate effects to pull, if your deck lack other ways to check your Reserve Deck.  
**[He Can Go About His Business](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/hecangoabouthisbusiness.gif) –** Brangus Glee decks do turn up once in a while, and they can really be a pain if you don’t have this shield.  
**[Ounee Ta](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/ouneeta.gif) –** <> sites aren’t seen too often, but this can be handy if they have a random Spaceport Docking Bay or something. Usually the 17th or 18th shield I want; rarely makes the cut.  
**[Planetary Defenses (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/planetarydefenses.gif) –** Just by virtue of this shield existing, Commence Primary Ignition decks that try to blow up all of your locations are never played anymore. Proton Bombs are occasionally played by particularly wacky players, so this is worth packing if you have room. Usually a 17th or 18th option though.  
**[Yavin Sentry (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/yavinsentry.gif) –** Playing against Colo Claw Fish is the worst, so this often makes the cut. Non-uniques are rarely seen.  
**[Your Ship?](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/yourship.gif) –** You will still see Sabacc every now and then, despite the existence of this shield, and it can be brutal when it’s timed right. (A good player will time it right.) If you see Brangus Glee, 4-LOM (on Cloud City), or troopers, putting this shield on the table isn’t the worst decision in the world.

_That One’s Garbage!:_

**[A Close Race](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/acloserace.gif) –** Never use this. Your Insight Serves You Well (V) is strictly better.  
**[Another Pathetic Lifeform](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/anotherpatheticlifeform.gif) –** You don’t need it. First, non-unique aliens and starfighters aren’t seen too terribly often. Second, limiting your opponent to two battle destiny isn’t very good. There are cards like Rebel Leadership (V), Evacuation Control (V), and the Tatooine system (the Episode I version) that are much more effective.  
**[Don&#8217;t Do That Again](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/dontdothatagain.gif) –** The virtual version is strictly better.  
**[Let&#8217;s Keep A Little Optimism Here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/letskeepalittleoptimismhere.gif) –** I haven’t seen operatives in a tournament since I returned to SWCCG. That’s a good thing, and it doesn’t seem likely to change any time soon. Skip this one.  
**[Planetary Defenses](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/planetarydefenses.gif) –** The virtual version is strictly better.  
**[Your Insight Serves You Well](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/yourinsightservesyouwell.gif) –** The virtual version is strictly better.

**<u>Dark Side</u>**

_You Want This, Don’t You?:_

**[A Useless Gesture (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/auselessgesture.gif) –** Without this shield, Watch Your Step can play a dozen or more interrupts from its Lost Pile during the game. With it, they’re limited (in practice) to three or four at most. Has the added benefit of making sure Revolution is rarely (if ever) played in Light Side decks anymore.  
**[Allegations Of Corruption](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/allegationsofcorruption.gif) –** See A Tragedy Has Occurred.  
**[Battle Order](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/battleorder.gif) –** See Battle Plan.  
**[Come Here You Big Coward](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/comehereyoubigcoward.gif) –** See Simple Tricks And Nonsense. This is a smidge more important than its mirror because Light Side has a lot more ways to retrieve Force.  
**[Do They Have A Code Clearance?](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/dotheyhaveacodeclearance.gif) –** Speaking of which, a lot of the more abusive ways for Light Side to retrieve Force are Interrupts and Utinni Effects: Kessel Run, Death Star Plans, On The Edge, Off The Edge, Harvest, Our Most Desperate Hour… even Jedi Levitation (V). This shield stops them from cycling those abusive cards back into their deck. It also reduces ALL of their retrieval – so Luke Skywalker (V) does nothing for the rest of the game, for example. This should be one of your shields, unless your deck plays the effect version.  
**[Firepower (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/firepower.gif) –** See Weapons Display (V), but instead of punishing exclusion from battle, Firepower (V) punishes moving away from a site you occupy during your turn – Dodge, Path Of Least Resistance, Run Luke Run, Hyper Escape, etc.  
**[Resistance](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/resistance.gif) –** See Ultimatum.  
[**Secret Plans**](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/secretplans.gif) – See Aim High, but again, Light Side has more retrieval, so this is even more important than its mirror.  
**[Vote Of No Confidence](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/voteofnoconfidence.gif) –** See The Republic No Longer Functions. Also prevents annoying things like Stone Pile.  
**[We&#8217;ll Let Fate-a Decide, Huh?](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/wellletfateadecidehuh.gif) –** This is much better than its mirror (Your Ship?) because it also cancels Beggar and Frozen Assets. If you’ve never been on the receiving end of a Beggar/Frozen Assets beatdown with Draw Their Fire, count yourself lucky and make sure to pack this shield.  
**[You Cannot Hide Forever (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/youcannothideforever.gif) –** See Your Insight Serves You Well (V).

_Goooood… Goooood…:_

**[I Find Your Lack Of Faith Disturbing (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/ifindyourlackoffaithdisturbing.gif) –** See Affect Mind (V). Note that Light Side Combat is quite a bit more prevalent than Dark Side Combat.  
**[Oppressive Enforcement](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/oppressiveenforcement.gif) –** See Wise Advice. Important if you rely on an effect that isn’t immune to Alter, such as Search And Destroy or Blaster Rack (non-V).  
**[There Is No Try](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/thereisnotry.gif) –** See Do, Or Do Not. Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi can get away with skipping the Sense and Alter shields, but note that Alter (V) gets around Hunt Down’s limitations.  
**[Weapon Of A Sith](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/weaponofasith.gif) –** See Only Jedi Carry That Weapon.

_She May Yet Be of Some Use to Us:_

**[A Useless Gesture](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/auselessgesture.gif) (non-V) –** You can play both versions of A Useless Gesture (V and non-V) under your starting effect, but you can only play one to the table, because it’s unique. The virtual version is better against Watch Your Step, but the non-virtual is worth considering just in case you run into a Ketwol deck. (They do turn up from time to time.)  
**[Death Star Sentry (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/deathstarsentry.gif) –** See Yavin Sentry (V). Note that Light Side non-uniques are seen a bit more frequently (Hidden Base, Watch Your Step with Palace Raiders, etc.).  
**[Fanfare (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/fanfare.gif) –** Same as Don’t Do That Again (V), except that Staging Areas is never played, so you don’t have to worry about it. This is handy if you have an Immediate Effect you want to pull (or just don’t have many other ways to check your deck), or if you’re scared of Lost In The Wilderness.  
**[Imperial Detention](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/imperialdetention.gif) –** While Goldenrod is a must-play for Light Side because of how prevalent Blizzard 4 is, the only real uses for Imperial Detention are Artoo-Detoo In Red 5 (with Luke Skywalker (V)), Panic, and Nightfall. Making the Red 5 combo cost 6 instead of 4 can be good—they deploy Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader and have 5 Force remaining; play this to stop the Red 5 beatdown—but it’s much narrower than Goldenrod. Panic and Nightfall turn up in Watch Your Step every once in a while, but the existence of this shield makes them no more than novelties.  
**[Wipe Them Out, All Of Them](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/wipethemoutallofthem.gif) –** Slightly better than its mirror, Another Pathetic Lifeform, because of Watch Your Step with Palace Raiders, which plays a lot of the non-unique aliens and can easily get up to three battle destinies.

_Bantha Poodoo:_

**[Crossfire](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/crossfire.gif) –** S-foils and Maneuvering Flaps are rarely (if ever) seen nowadays. To the extent they are played (which isn’t much), X-wing swarm decks usually skip S-foils because being able to move is important. Speeder decks prefer the virtual Maneuvering Flaps (which Crossfire doesn’t work against). Also, neither of those two cards is particularly broken or abusive. You’ve got more important things to worry about.  
**[Fanfare](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/fanfare.gif) –** The virtual version is strictly better.  
**[Leave Them To Me](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/leavethemtome.gif) –** Ops are dead. Long live Ops.  
**[No Escape](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/noescape.gif) –** Putting Nudj’s at <> sites used to be really good in 1999. And that was the last time anyone played it. (The Effect version of this is a really good card though.)  
**[You Cannot Hide Forever](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/youcannothideforever.gif) –** The virtual version is strictly better.  
**[You&#8217;ve Never Won A Race?](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/youveneverwonarace.gif) –** You Cannot Hide Forever (V) is strictly better.

In addition to your four shields per game that you get by default, there are also six virtual card that can get an extra shield for you:

Hear Me Baby, Hold Together (V)  
Perimeter Scan (V)  
Red 8 (V)  
Cold Feet (V)  
Turn It Off! Turn It Off! (V)  
Onyx 2 (V)

As I mentioned at the top of this list, it’s helpful to think of defensive shields as “rules of the game.” So, assume Battle Order and Secret Plans will always be in play. Assume that you’ll need to be at two battlegrounds in order to retrieve. Assume that you’ll have to lose 2 Force to Sense interrupts. Assume that you’ll need to stack and pay for interrupts played from your Lost Pile in Watch Your Step. Assume that your Podrace won’t make your opponent lose any Force. Don’t play Colo Claw Fish, or Revolution, or Beggar, or Frozen Assets, or Bad Feeling Have I. Sometimes you’ll get lucky and you won’t be subject to one of those restrictions, but it’s best to plan for the worst.

**Card of the Fortnight**

In this section, I’m going to highlight cards that you often see in competitive decklists, but whose usefulness might not be immediately apparent to new players.

Our first Card of the Fortnight is a special twofer: Evacuation Control (V) and Imperial Justice (V). These cards are exact mirrors of one another and were released in Set 0 (the cards that stuck around after the 2014 Reset).

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8834" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/evacuationcontrol-214x300.gif" alt="evacuationcontrol" width="214" height="300" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8835" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/imperialjustice-214x300.gif" alt="imperialjustice" width="214" height="300" /> 

These cards do four important things:

  1. **They limit both sides to one battle destiny.** Adding battle destinies used to be the province of hard-to-pull-off interrupts like Skywalkers and Don’t Get Cocky. Today, we have things like Grand Moff Tarkin (V); Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel; Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter; Watch Your Step/This Place Can Be A Little Rough; Death Star II: Capacitors; and many others. There’s a lot of destiny-adding in the modern game, and Evac/Justice is a great way to make sure multiple destinies only happen when you want them to. They also makes your cards with immunity to attrition really shine. For example, if your characters/ships at a location are immune to attrition <5, and your opponent can only draw one battle destiny, it has to be a 5 or higher, or else your characters/ships will stick around—letting you satisfy Battle Plan for that much longer, block their drain for that much longer, or even counterattack on a subsequent turn.
  2. **They prevent those battle destinies from being modified.** This includes cards like Close Call (V), Darth Vader (V), and Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Learner.
  3. **They prevent those destinies from being cancelled.** This includes cards like We Have A Plan/They Will Be Lost And Confused; Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader; My Kind Of Scum/Fearless And Inventive; and even good old non-V Grand Moff Tarkin from Premiere.
  4. **In order to use it, you choose a card stacked on it and put it in your hand.** Unless you have Toryn Farr (V) on the table, this means you only get to use it three times per game, so choose wisely. It also means you get to see three random cards from your Reserve Deck and pick one each time you use it. If you stack a Ghhhk or Houjix on it, you’re in luck! If it looks like you’re going to get hit for a lot of battle damage, simply keep calm and pick up the Ghhhk.

That does it for this fortnight. In two weeks, I’ll recap the Endor Grand Prix and talk a little bit about going to your first major tournament.

Peace, Love, and High Destinies,
