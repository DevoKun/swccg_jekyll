From Shewski, Design Advocate:

Greetings, Star Wars players!

It&#8217;s been a while since any official news has broken on the rest of Set 1, so let&#8217;s change that.

As a reminder, when we released the Master List for the new Standard (&#8220;Reset&#8221;) environment, we also released a preview of Set 1. Since then, players have been asking when they can expect the rest of the set. I&#8217;m pleased to announce that our target date for Set 1 is March 18. This date is significant only in that it is approximately 6 weeks out from the MPC. As a worst case scenario, we would release no later than April 1 (4 weeks out) but we are going to do everything to hit that target date.

So, what does it look like? Right now (I just did an update this morning) the set is 10 cards for both LS and DS. This has been a challenge for the design team, as that&#8217;s not a lot of real estate to work with, especially as we are still all learning about the new Standard environment. Despite that, I feel the team has done a good job of making the most out of a few card slots and that we will enjoy exploring the new options this mini-sized set brings.

One challenge of the set was trying to respect the meta as we were designing. I think as a result some themes in the set are a little more incomplete than others, but we were trying to be conscious of not overdeveloping the meta. What does incomplete mean? Well, one of the themes for DS is ISB. There were lots of neat ideas for helper effects and locations that ultimately I decided should wait &#8211; simply since DS has a lot of good options in Standard now. What did make it into the set, and is something that I hope future sets will build off of that all ISB agents in the set have some text in common that triggers when deploying:

> •Colonel Wullf Yularen (V) 2  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Premiere &#8211; U1]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL  
> POWER 1 ABILITY 2  
> Text: [Pilot]1, 2: any capital starship. When deployed, may activate up to X Force (limit 4), where X = number of ISB agents on table. While aboard a starship, its power may not be reduced.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 5  
> \[Pilot\]\[Warrior\]  
> Set Icon 1

It&#8217;s totally not Battlecry, and I totally don&#8217;t spend way too much time playing Hearthstone. =)

Other objectives helped in the set involve Black Sun, We Have A Plan, and Watch Your Step. We might explore a little more of those in a later post.

Some of the things I&#8217;ve said before about Set 1 are still true. As of today, Imperial Entanglements, very much like it was in legacy is slated to be in the set. There are some cards that address Reflections III cards&#8230; the ones that help with Maintenance cards I&#8217;ll wait on but, here&#8217;s another neat DS card:

> •Djas Puhr (V) 1  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Premiere &#8211; R2]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 1 ABILITY 4 FORCE-SENSITIVE  
> Text: Your total ability may not be reduced at same site. Your Force drains here may not be canceled by [Reflections III] Leia. Djas Puhr is power, defense value and forfeit +1 for each [Dark Side] icon here.  
> DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 4  
> [Warrior]  
> Set Icon 1

For a long while, we did have Where Are You Taking This Thing? back in, as well as a LS mirror, but recently they got cut. I think their prime use wasn&#8217;t needed just quite yet due to the relative popularity of IAO/Insurrection, so I envision them coming back, just not so soon.

The big thing we wanted to have in the set, but will not be, is a new take on Sith&#8217;s/Jedi&#8217;s Plans. We started testing a very open ended version of these that deployed direct to the table, and pulled almost any battleground for 2, or a related battleground for 1. We didn&#8217;t really like the testing that was coming back &#8211; it was the same usual location suspects that got pulled and we didn&#8217;t really want people to fight over the 3/2 over and over again. So, we pulled them, but for the time being we felt that LS deserved something like this:

> •A New Secret Base (V) 5  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Third Anthology &#8211; PM]  
> EFFECT  
> Text: Deploy on table. Once per turn, may use 2 Force to \/ a battleground system. Your non-unique starfighters apply their deployment modifiers at any location. Once per turn, if you just Force drained at a battleground system, may draw top card of Reserve Deck. [Immune to Alter]  
> Set Icon 1

My plan is to eventually have the master list (once we have less changes being made) posted publicly VERY early on, much like we did with the Reset experience. I really liked the open testing and results sharing we had, and I don&#8217;t think I would like to go back to the old way of doing things. I very much encourage you to test with some of the more splashable cards found in here and hopefully I will have more and more I can share in later posts. For now, I&#8217;ll end with one of my favorite LS cards of the set. Some in testing are saying this is too good, so please test it out and share your results!!

> •Green Leader In Green Squadron 1 [A-wing Cannon (V)] <del>3</del> 2  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Death Star II &#8211; C]  
> STARFIGHTER &#8211; A-WING  
> POWER 5 MANEUVER 5 HYPERSPEED 4  
> Text: Permanent pilot is •Green Leader, who provides ability of 2. Adds one battle destiny with an A-wing, B-wing, X-wing or Y-wing. During battle, may cancel a starship’s immunity to attrition; this starship &#8216;hit.&#8217;
