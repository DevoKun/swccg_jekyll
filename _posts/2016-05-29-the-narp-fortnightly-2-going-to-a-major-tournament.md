Hi, everyone,

In case you haven’t been paying attention on the forums or the Facebook page, the Endor Grand Prix was last weekend. I thought this would be a good opportunity to talk about going to your first major tournament: what to expect, how to prepare, and what to take away.

Major tournaments are packed weekends, with SWCCG events taking place from Friday evening through late Sunday afternoon. World Championships have events beginning on Friday morning as well. As an example, I played 16 games of Star Wars during the Endor weekend—and that was just the games that counted. There were at least 4 or 5 friendly “pick-up” games that were just for fun or playtesting.

Not everybody plays for the full weekend; we all have lives, after all. Some people just come for the main event on Saturday, and sometimes work schedules will only allow somebody to be there for some of the Friday or Sunday side events. All of that is fine! The more, the merrier.

To new players, major events are important for a few reasons:

  1. **They accelerate your improvement at the game.** Nowhere else can you play this much SWCCG, against this many different opponents, in this short of a time period. The amount of experience and knowledge you gain is tangible; at all the major tournaments I’ve been to, I’ve been a better Star Wars player on Sunday than I was on Friday.
  2. **They are the best opportunity to meet other SWCCG players.** This is where you match faces to the names you’ve been reading on the forums, make new friends, and reconnect with people you might not have seen in a while.
  3. **They’re fun!**

** **So, we’ve covered the “why,” now let’s talk about the “how.” These are some tips gleaned from my own experience and from talking to other players, both new and old:

**Coming to the Event**

One thing that helps a lot at your first event, which may or may not be possible for you, depending on where you live, is to **come with a group of players.** Not only does this cut down on hotel expenses, but it also means you’ll already know at least a few people, and they can introduce you around. Additionally, it might give you a “team” of playtesting buddies who can give you tips and advice in the weeks, days, and hours leading up to the tournament. However, going it alone is still very possible, so don’t be discouraged!

When you’re at the event, **don’t be shy!** Introduce yourself to other players. (Ask them what their forum handles are, if you need a little context.) Get into conversations—maybe even conversations that don’t involve SWCCG! If a group of people are going out to dinner, ask if you can tag along!

This is optional and depends on your lifestyle choices, but **be prepared to stay up late.** The organized SWCCG events will end at a reasonable hour, but late at night, you’ll find guys playing board games, playing pick-up and sealed SWCCG, and maybe even consuming a few adult beverages responsibly. This is where casual acquaintances become close friendships, and for many players, it’s the most fun part of the weekend!

**Playing SWCCG at the Event**

More experienced players will often agonize over their deck choices for major events, but you shouldn’t. When you’re starting out, **play what you know.** It doesn’t have to be the most competitive deck in the meta, with zero bad matchups; you just have to know what your cards do and understand how your deck works. Nothing is worse than being in a competitive environment and not knowing what your own deck does. As you gain more experience and learn/build new decks, you can start thinking about matchups and meta choices. But when you’re just starting out, stick to your personal _terra firma_.

You should always pay attention to what happens in your games, and in games you observe. You should try to **learn something from every game.** Maybe you thought your deck was great against Hunt Down, but you lost to Hunt Down when your opponent made a play you weren’t expecting. Think about what you would have done differently in each game, and what you’ll do differently in your next game.

After a game, **don’t be afraid to ask for advice.** If you’re a new or returning player, most people are happy to share tips with you, so don’t be shy! Learning doesn’t stop either; you’ll often see experienced players leave the board set up after a game and deconstruct what happened: “I spread my guys out because I was holding the Barrier.” “I was digging for my Free Ride combo but didn’t find it until it was too late.” “If you had deployed Justice, I never would’ve battled there.” This is a friendly community where we all root for each other and help each other improve.

**Leaving the Event**

Some people like to leave a party without telling anyone (the “Irish goodbye”), but a major tournament isn’t the time for that. (Really, it’s never the time for that; those people are just being rude and trying to mask it as “folksy.”) Instead, say your goodbyes and **keep in touch.** With Facebook, the swccg.org forums, and other modern technology, it’s easier than ever. Each person you meet is a potential sounding board for your future ideas, a possible source of future decks, or even a friend to meet up with when you’re in their city. Don’t be a stranger!

Don’t spend too much time navel-gazing, and **don’t Monday-morning quarterback yourself.** It’s important to acknowledge your mistakes, but not to beat yourself up over them. Instead of focusing on your results (wins and losses), review the lessons you learned from each game, and how they will make you a better player in the future.

Finally, **take what you’ve learned and set your goals for the next event.** You should try to improve at each major you go to. That doesn’t always have to be in terms of wins and losses. For example, if I’m dwelling on a half-dozen bad mistakes from the weekend, I might set a goal of making only four bad mistakes at the next major. It can be anything you want; just keep coming back!

**Card of the Fortnight**

Last fortnight, we discussed [Evacuation Control (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/evacuationcontrol.gif) and [Imperial Justice (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/imperialjustice.gif), and why they are so powerful. This week, we’re going to look at a group of cards that are powerful (in part) because they help you play around Evac and Justice:

[All Wings Report In & Darklighter Spin](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Light/allwingsreportin&darklighterspin.gif)  
[Short Range Fighters & Watch Your Back!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/shortrangefighters&watchyourback.gif)  
[Smoke Screen](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/smokescreen.gif)

These three cards allow you to substitute a battle destiny draw with some other number – either the maneuver number of your starfighter or the ability number of your character. The power of these cards is obvious: If you have Mace Windu (ability 7) in battle against Vader (immune to attrition <5), you can draw a battle destiny and hope you get a 5, or you can play Smoke Screen and guarantee yourself a 7. But there are a few other things to consider that might not be as obvious:

**The substituted destiny is not considered to be a “draw.”** That means [Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Learner](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/anakinskywalkerpadawanlearner.gif) can’t add to it; [Darth Vader (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/darthvader.gif) and [Wooof (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/wooof.gif) can’t subtract from it; and [Close Call (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/closecall.gif) can’t redraw it OR subtract from it. It also means [Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/wedgeantillesredsquadronleader.gif) can’t cancel it. However, [Zuckuss In Mist Hunter](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/zuckussinmisthunter.gif) can still reduce it to 0, and [Toryn Farr (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/torynfarr.gif) can still add to it, because those cards affect “total battle destiny” and not “battle destiny **draws.**”

It also means that when Evac/Justice say that you “draw no more than one battle destiny,” substituted values from these three cards don’t count toward the limit—because they’re not draws!

**In order to play one of these interrupts, you must be “about to draw a card for battle destiny.”** That means you have to be able to draw before you can substitute. Consider this example:

_[Han, Chewie, And The Falcon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/hanchewieandthefalcon.gif) is at a system, in battle against [Baron Soontir Fel](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/baronsoontirfel.gif) in [Saber 1](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/saber1.gif). Dark Side also has Imperial Justice (V), with at least one card still stacked on it. __Dark Side picks up a card from Imperial Justice (V) during the weapons segment, so both players will only be able to draw one battle destiny. Can Light Side:_

-Draw the first destiny (let’s say it’s a 3)  
-Then play All Wings Report In & Darklighter Spin to make the second destiny a 6?

**No.** Once Light Side draws the first destiny, they’re no longer “about to draw” the second, because of Imperial Justice (V)’s limitation. What could Light Side do to make this work?

-Play the interrupt FIRST, making the first destiny a 6  
-Then draw the second (it’ll be the same 3 as before)

If Light Side substitutes the first destiny, they haven’t drawn one yet (because a substitution is not a draw!), so they can draw the second normally, even with Imperial Justice (V) in effect. Some players call this “spinning around Justice.”

Let’s try another example:

_Same as before, except Dark Side doesn’t have Justice on the table, and Light Side only has one card remaining in Reserve Deck. Can Light Side:_

-Draw the first destiny, the last card in Reserve Deck (let’s say it’s a 3)  
-Then play All Wings Report In & Darklighter Spin to make the second destiny a 6?

**No again.** In order to substitute with one of these interrupts, you must be “about to draw,” and if there are no cards left in your Reserve Deck, then you’re not “about to draw” anything! Just as before, Light Side would have to play the interrupt first, then draw the second destiny.

Last example:

_At a site, [Prince Xizor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/princexizor.gif) is in a battle against [Luke With Lightsaber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Light/lukewithlightsaber.gif)._

-Can Light Side play Smoke Screen for a battle destiny of 5?  
-What if Light Side picks up a card from Evacuation Control (V) and then plays Smoke Screen?

**Again, no.** Xizor says Light Side needs ability of 6 to draw battle destiny. Light Side only has ability 5, so they’re not “about to draw.” Evac won’t help; it prevents your destiny from being cancelled, but Xizor doesn’t cancel a destiny draw; he stops Light Side from drawing in the first place.

It can take some time to get used to all of these interactions, but in practiced hands, substituting destiny draws can be an extremely powerful tactic.

That does it for this fortnight. See you in two weeks!

Peace, Love, and High Destinies,
