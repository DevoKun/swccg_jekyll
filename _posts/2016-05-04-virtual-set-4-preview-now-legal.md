Hey SWCCG fans,

While the D&D team is working with playtesting and proofers on finishing up Set 4, we&#8217;re proud to have a small preview ready for the Endor Grand Prix (<http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=937>) and for the rest of the community to start playing with.

These are the first cards to feature themes from the latest Star Wars saga movie, The Force Awakens, and we&#8217;re excited to add fresh new faces and potential to the card pool. The preview set is legal immediately for all SWCCG events.

So without any further ado, go print the new cards and awaken the force within!

And lastly, a huge thanks to the card design teams and to the public for your continued patience with the design and development of this new set!

May the Fourth Be With You,  
-The Advocates and D&D team
