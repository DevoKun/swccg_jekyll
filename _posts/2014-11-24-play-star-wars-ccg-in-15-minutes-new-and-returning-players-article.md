So you clicked on the New and Returning Player (NARP) and have been flooded with information. All you really want to do is get your hands dirty and kill someone with a lightsaber. This is your lucky day! There are two online options, neither of which require you to purchase any cards.  
If you have been away for the game for significant amount of time and don’t remember all of the basic rules then a web-based, rules enforced Star Wars CCG server called “GEMP-Swccg” is your best option. Forum user tbiesty created this server and continues to add cards. This is the quickest, easiest way for a returning player to find a quick game.
