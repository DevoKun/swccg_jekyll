### General description:

CCT 12 Card Mains is mainly a battle deck. It’s designed to put together combinations of strong characters in order to fight and defeat an opponent’s characters wherever they go. Overall, the playstyle of the deck is mainly to wait for an opponent to attempt to setup some form of damage and to battle it.

To accomplish this lofty goal, the deck comes with several distinct features involving a captive. CCT first requires light side (LS) players to imprison one rebel from their deck at the Cloud City prison. This captive will serve two important purposes. First, he can be escorted by <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/ig88.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IG-88 (V)</a>. IG-88 (V), when escorting a captive, can take any one card into hand from your force pile. This allows access to the cards you need when you need them. Being able to get the card you want when you want it allows CCT players to successfully battle opponents through acquiring their game-changing cards first. Second, the captive can also be brought to the Cloud City: Carbonite Chamber and carbon-froze to cause a loss of 8 force.

### General strategy

_Setup_. Getting IG-88 (V) out and getting your locations out in order to finance the expensive turns to come. The lone exception to getting locations out is getting cards, like Stunning Leader, to defend IG-88 (V) against decks with lots of spies (TRM and Diplo usually play the most).

_Then&#8230;_

_Attack_. Pulling the characters, interrupts, and sometimes a starship you need to disrupt or out-damage whatever your opponent is attempting to accomplish.

**Or..**

_Bait and Counter Attack_: Pulling cards needed to cancel/prevent an opponent’s battle and the cards needed to battle them on your turn after canceling/preventing their battle.  
• Used when an opponent is not attempting to immediately accomplish something and is instead waiting to see what you do. Although lacking in force drains, this deck has two options to entice an opponent into action: Carbon-Freezing and Search & Destroy.  
• If an opponent attacks you to attempt to prevent Carbon-Freezing or to cancel Search & Destroy, their attack can be cancelled or prevented with Stunning leader, Imperial Barriers, and/or Projective Telepathy. After doing so, they’ve now given you something to do what this deck does best: battle!

### Key cards:

**Characters**:

_Weapon users_: In order to cause as much damage as possible during a battle, it’s important to either remove an opponent’s characters from battle or to reduce their forfeit value. In order to accomplish this while maximizing deck space, this decks uses a variety of characters who have built in, forfeit reducing weapons.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/darthmaulwithlightsaber.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darth Maul with Lightsaber: </a>Can swing his saber twice!

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/darthvaderwithlightsaber.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darth Vader with Lightsaber</a>: Used with Grand Moff Tarkin (V) and Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter for multiple battle destinies.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/dengarwithblastercarbine.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dengar with Blaster Carbine (V)</a>: Excellent when used in conjunction with Force Lightning used or against low defense value characters.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/marajadewithlightsaber.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mara Jade with Lightsaber</a>: Cheaper than Vader and Maul and also moves for free when using Elis with Emperor or Luke on table!

_Utility Characters_: These characters fulfill a variety of purposes, such as countering interrupts, reducing defense value, and more.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/ig88.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IG-88 (V)</a>: When escorting a captive, can take one card into hand from force pile each turn. He’s what makes this deck work.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/drevazan&pondababa.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Evazan & Ponda Baba</a>: Can ‘operate’ on hit characters to make them immediately lost. Game changer!

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/4lomwithconcussionrifle.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-LOM With Concussion Rifle</a>: Can cancel the game-text of an opponent’s character by shooting them. Qui-gon Jinn with Lightsaber is really, really good against Maul&#8230; right up until this guy zaps him.  
• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/4lomwithconcussionrifle.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a><a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/4lomwithconcussionrifle.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-LOM With Concussion Rifle (V)</a>: Alternative to 4-lom with rifle non-V. Can place a card from hand on bottom of used pile to draw top card of reserve deck. Can be started against Profit by deploying Daroe (V) as one of your aliens to generally make the match-up unwinnable for Profit. Can be used with Emperor to build your hand for free (Emperor pulls force lightning and 4-LOM puts it back to draw another card into hand). Ranges from excellent to useless depending on match-up.  
 _Against LS mains and LS decks that are vulnerable in space during their early turns, 4-lom non-V is generally better. Against slower LS decks requiring specific cards to beat, 4-lom (V) is generally better._

• Kir Kanos (V): Once per game, when in battle with an imperial, may cancel one interrupt that isn’t immune to sense. Usually used to cancel cards that protect characters from weapons or attempt to allow a character to escape a battle.

• Myn Kyneugh (V): When deployed, may deploy a defensive shield. Once per game, may use 1 Force to place an interrupt out of play. Battles are often decided by interrupts. As a result, Myn can allow an interrupt that changes one battle to not change another. He basically fills the slot of a grabber and a shield pulling interrupt. Also a leader and this allows Grand Moff Tarkin (V) to add a battle destiny when with him.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/emperorpalpatine.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emperor Palpatine</a>: Destiny 6! o Can pull Force Lighting to kill low defensive value characters or reduce the defense value of high defensive value characters. He’s a defensive specialist. When knowing an opponent will attack you at the Carbonite Chamber, you want to put the Emperor there first to make them fight into Force Lightning. Can be put on the Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle with Tarkin or Boba Fett for 3 battle destiny draws and immunity to attrition.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/countdooku.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Count Dooku</a>: Can also be targeted by Force Lightning. In combination with Force Lighting, Dooku can be used to make it much, much easier to hit LS Jedi with weapons. Unlike the Emperor, he can deploy and move to sites where the opponent has presence. He can be used offensively. Excellent character to put at the Audience Chamber or Carbonite Chamber when setting up Search & Destroy.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/arica.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arica (V)</a>: Situational but strong alternative to Mara with Lightsaber. During your control phase, may retrieve 1 Force when she’s present at a battleground and Luke is not. Note: Luke must be present at a battleground meaning she still retrieves even if he’s in a speeder or on a starship. Her retrieval absolutely destroys decks like Hidden Base. Against LSJK decks where her retrieval won’t usually come into play, she’s a spy and can deployed to an opponent’s twix instead.  
_Overall, Mara with Lightsaber is better against most LSJK decks and Arica (V) is generally better against everything else. For open play, I favor Arica (V)._

_Destiny Adding Characters:_

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/grandmofftarkin.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Moff Tarkin (V)</a>: When with an imperial leader or Vader, adds one battle destiny. More damage! During battle may cancel and redraw a destiny if it’s less than the number of imperials. This is huge for trying to hit Jedi with lightsabers.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/bobafettbountyhunter.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter</a>: Power 7 for only 5 force and adds two battle destinies when with Vader or another bounty hunter. When it comes to piling on the battle damage, he is the master.

**Starships:**

As primarily a battle deck, this deck mostly focuses on the ground where it’s easier to reduce forfeit, make characters lost, and cause game-winning damage. There are very few ships and their general purpose is to satisfy Battle Plan/Order for free drains, setting up resistance against LS space decks, and probing systems against Hidden Base. Play at least 2 starships and never more than 3.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/zuckussinmisthunter.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zuckuss in Mist Hunter</a>: Unless opponent has >6 ability piloting, their battle destiny is reset to 0. If you were going to only play 1 ship, this would be the ship. Combines with 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle to draw 2 battle destinies in one of the most card efficient space combos.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/maulssithinfiltrator.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maul’s Sith Infiltrator</a>: Can cloak with Maul aboard. Not often deployed or used. However, the ship can still be necessary against decks like Hidden Base. Some decks combine Maul&#8217;s cloaking with Much Anger in Him to block a drain while causing further force loss.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/emperorspersonalshuttle.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emperor’s Personal Shuttle</a>: Immune to attrition and adds one battle destiny when Emperor aboard (who deploys free aboard!). Emperor’s shuttle with Emperor and Tarkin (V) both abroad draws 3 battle destiny, can redraw any 1’s that are drawn for battle destiny, and is immune to attrition. In a mostly ground deck, this very efficient spaceship can catch players who are expecting pressure on the ground off guard and completely change games.

### Interrupts:

The majority of battles can be decided by the interrupts played. As a result, CCT 12 Card Mains plays a variety of interrupts to fight battles on your terms and win them.

_Defensive Interrupts:_  
• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Dark/stunningleader.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stunning Leader</a>: Can cancel a battle by excluding all leaders and characters of ability >2 from the battle. Because this deck needs IG-88 (V) to be escorting a captive, he is vulnerable to being attacked by spies. Stunning leader is the primary card that protects him from this.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/imperialbarrier.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial Barrier</a>: Can prevent a just deployed character or starship from moving or battling for the remainder of the turn.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/ghhhk&thoserebelswontescapeus.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghhhk & Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us</a> (Ghhhk combo): Cancels all remaining battle damage if you’ve forfeited every card from a battle. Can also be played to cancel a react, namely Dodge and sometimes Finn and Spiral. Can also cancel Nabrun Leids. This is extremely helpful for protecting IG-88 from a Nabrun beat down as well as preventing Nabrun from being used to allow an opponent to escape a beat down. Given how important it is to cancel Dodge and Nabrun, I always play Ghhk combo over regular ghhhk.

_Battle Interrupts:_  
• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/sense.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sense</a>: Allows you to cancel any non-sense immune interrupt. Given the sheer variety of interrupts that can be used to escape, stop, or drastically change a battle, this card is very important.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/ihaveyounow.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I Have You Now</a>: If your Dark Jedi is with a Rebel of ability >2, add one battle destiny. If with Luke, add two! Luke can be extremely hard to kill. This card can make it easy.

_Utility interrupts:_  
• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/forcepush.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Force Push (V)</a>: Once per game, may exchange two cards in hand with one card in force pile. This helps get IG-88 (V) out quickly.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/preparethechamber.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prepare The Chamber</a>: Adds 2 to any just drawn carbon freezing destiny. This cards makes it so only a 4 is necessary for destiny when attempting to carbon freeze a captive.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/sithfury.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sith Fury (V)</a>: May take a just drawn character for destiny into hand. This deck has multiple destiny 1 characters it doesn&#8217;t want to draw. This card helps immensely with making those characters less of an issue.

• Force Lightning: Used: Reduces the defensive value of a character with Emperor or Dooku by 4 for the remainder of turn. This deck doesn’t have great destiny numbers. As a result, Force Lightning is often needed in order to hit characters like Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight with weapons. Lost: Targets a character present with Emperor. If destiny +1> defensive value, target is lost. Can be useful for getting rid of low defense value characters and especially cards you want removed outside of battle, like Corporal Delevar (V) or Jar Jar Binks.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/surfacedefense.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surface Defense (V)</a>: Use 1 force to deploy one alter immune effect from reserve deck. In addition to providing your 12 card starting hand, this can pull First Strike, Jabba’s Haven, and No Escape.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/wemustaccelerateourplans.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Must Accelerate Our Plans</a>: It pulls the Blockade Bridge for more activation. Can also pull an effect for 3 force (usually used to get Search And Destroy against Hidden Base). Never play without at least 1!

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/theyrestillcomingthrough.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They’re Still Coming Through!</a>: Cancels Rebel Barrier, It’s a Trap, and Smoke Screen. Also, can retarget Fallen Portal onto opponent’s characters. Barrier, It’s a Trap (immune to sense), and Fallen Portal are all excellent cards against aggressive decks, like this deck. As a result, it’s important to be able to counter them.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/elishelrot.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elis Helrot</a>: Can teleport your characters from one site to another at the cost of whatever destiny you draw. Excellent for preventing an opponent from avoiding your stronger characters and also for causing a game-changing battle.

• Point man (V): During any draw phase, may place a card from hand under used pile to take any card from force pile into hand. Can also cancel Keep Your Eyes Open (V), a good card against this kind of deck. However, sense is usually better. Excellent against Grimtaash as it allows you to reduce your hand size. With IG-88 (V), taking a card from force pile is usually redundant. Nevertheless, playing one of these to put back a high destiny card can be extremely helpful. Play only if you&#8217;re not playing 4-lom (V).

### Effects:

As a result of being a 12 card start and not starting effects, CCT 12 Card Mains plays very few but very important effects.  
• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/jabbashaven.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jabba’s Haven</a>: May deploy Nal Hutta from reserve deck. Once per game, may retrieve one independent starship or alien into hand. This can retrieve Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, Mara, Dengar, and even Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba into hand. It’s incredible.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/firststrike.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Strike</a>: In battles you’ve initiated, this requires the opponent to pay 1 force for each interrupt they use. When battles are largely decided by interrupts, this can put a limit on their ability to withhold your attack. Also, allows initiators of battles to retrieve 1 force and cause 1 force loss. This retrieval and force loss can help mitigate the force drains when unable to clear all the sites of control deck.

• Carbon-Freezing: Deploys on Carbonite Chamber. During your control phase, may target a non-frozen captive present and draw destiny. If destiny >10, target frozen and opponent loses 8 force. Between controlling the carbonite chamber (+2 to destiny), the chamber console (+3 to destiny), and prepare the chamber (+2 to destiny), it only takes a destiny of 4 to freeze a captive and cause massive damage.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/noescape.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Escape</a>: When deployed, may take top card of lost pile into hand. This is used to get back important cards to play them again, such as getting another Maul, Ghhhk, Stunning Leader, etc.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Endor-Dark/searchanddestroy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search And Destroy</a>: While you occupy two battleground sites with characters of destiny <4 and opponent has no character of destiny <4 at a battleground site, opponent losses 1 force during each draw phase. This deck is made to battle and has very little potential for damage with force drains. As a result, what do you do if your opponent doesn’t give you something to battle? Search & Destroy is the answer. This deck can put one character each at the Carbonite Chamber and Audience Chamber to setup S&D and protect them both with Stunning Leader.

### Locations:

CCT 12 Card mains needs a lot of force. It plays lots of characters while also taking cards out of its own force pile with IG-88 (V). As a result, it plays a variety of locations and can play some with useful features. If TRM and other LS mains decks are popular (decks that give you few icons), 7 locations is ideal. If decks that give you activation are popular, 6 locations is ideal.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/cloudcitysecuritytower.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security Tower (V)</a>: Starting location where the captive goes.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/cloudcitycarbonitechamber.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbonite Chamber</a>: Starting location where carbon-freezing can happen.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/jabbaspalaceaudiencechamber.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audience Chamber</a>: Can be pulled with your objective. Once per game, can deploy an alien from reserve deck. This is incredibly useful for setting up Search And Destroy. It’s an interior site so Stunning Leader can be used there. Also, after you cancel a battle with Stunning Leader, the text can be used to pull an alien to help with the counter-battle. Against LS space and/or speeder decks, this can pull Arica (V) or Daroe (V) to pull 4-LOM (V).

• Hoth Ice Plains (V): 2/0 Hoth site that cancels Ice Storm and once per game, allows you to swap an interrupt from hand with the bottom card of reserve deck. Ice Storm is very detrimental to this deck when attacking Hoth. Cancelling it is huge. Similarly, the once per game text can help turn a bad starting hand into a better one.

• Nal Hutta: 2/1 system where opponent&#8217;s drains are -1. It&#8217;s played in order to have a system and because it&#8217;s pullable by Jabba’s Haven (which is pullable with Surface Defense (V) &#8211; guaranteeing a high probability of being able to deploy Nal Hutta relatively early). This gives you a battle ground system to throw Zuckuss in Mist Hunter at to allow for free drains and can also help setup resistance if needed.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/blockadeflagshipbridge.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockade Flagship Bridge</a>: 2/0 site that’s pullable by We Must Accelerate Our Plans. It’s wonderful.

### &#8220;61st cards:&#8221; Cards to be played some of the time but not always

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Dark/monnok.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monnok</a> &#8211; interrupt: Used: If opponent has more than 12 cards in hand, place all but 8 of those cards in used pile. Lost: Use 4 force and reveal opponents hand. All duplicate cards are lost. Excellent for restricting the number of tricks an opponent can have by limiting their hand size.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/youarebeaten.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You Are Beaten</a> &#8211; interrupt: Uses 2 force to exclude one character present with your lightsaber wielding character until the end of your next turn. Allows the removal of a character during battle even against K’lor Slug. Excellent for causing overflow but can result in substantial force loss to the defensive shield Weapons Display (V).

• Projective Telepathy &#8211; interrupt: If an opponent initiated a force drain or battle, they must use 2 force or it is canceled. An alternative to Imperial Barrier. Generally, it&#8217;s better in the very early and very late game but worse in the mid-game than Barrier. Works well with Broken Concentration, R&#8217;tic H&#8217;well, and Greedo (V) for a substantial force choke.

• Dagobah Cave &#8211; site: It’s a 2/0 site that spies can’t deploy to. It also causes the opponent to lose 1 force if Yoda is on table and not on Dagobah. Yoda, Keeper of the Peace is able to cancel Force Lightning, an important card to this deck. Good but not as good as the Ice Plains (V). Excellent add against LS mains to minimize their force choke and limit the effectiveness of Yoda, Keeper of the Peace.

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/greedo.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greedo (V)</a> &#8211; character: Makes opponent need to use 1 force to fire each weapon when with Greedo. Typically, LS mains decks will and should commit multiple characters to the Carbonite Chamber. May deploy as a react. This has a variety of uses, such as deploying him as a react on ZiMH against Ello Asty in Red 6 (who would otherwise clear ZiMH thanks to its attrition bonus of 1).

• <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/darthsidious.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darth Sidious</a> &#8211; character: When no other characters present, may lose 1 force to place opponent’s just lost Jedi out of play. When pulled off, this can cripple a variety of LS mains decks. Nevertheless, he’s often too expensive to play and you need to spend 6 force on cards that can help kill Jedi in the first place rather than place them out of play.

• Force Field (V) – interrupt: Cancels a weapon attack targeting your character of ability >4. Very helpful against LS mains.

• 2nd I Have You Now – interrupt: o When known to play IHYN, players will play more patiently and wait until they can get a counter (usually Hear Me Baby (V)) before deploying LSJK. When this happens, it often becomes better to play 2 IHYN or none at all.

• 2nd Count Dooku – character:  
o Force Lightning makes it substantial easier to hit LS mains. Similarly, if playing Force Field (V) and/or Close Call (V), Dooku is the next best character after IG-88 (V) to escort the captive for carbon freezing when unable to get IG-88 (V) out.

• 2nd ghhhk and 3rd Maul – anti-LS mains tech: CCT generally has a slower setup than LS mains decks. As a result, when attempting to fight LS mains decks early on, they’ll enjoy a relatively large advantage. They’ll have more characters and many of those characters will be stronger than yours. One way to pick apart this early advantage is to suicide Maul into their pack of characters and ghhk their overflow. An additionally Ghhk and Maul will allow this play to be made earlier and more often.

• Much Anger in Him &#8211; effect: Deploy on a rebel. If you have presence at this rebel’s location and they did not initiate a battle, opponent loses 4 force. This has two major uses:  
 Use with a cloaked Maul in his ship in space to block a drain, satisfy battle plan, and cause additional damage. This card is even better in CCT since Theron Nett (V), a counter to cloaking, is often given as the captive.  
 If you have a pack of characters on table that an opponent is now avoiding, this can help make those characters more useful.

• Overload – interrupt: Targets a weapon and draws destiny. If destiny is lower than the destiny number of the weapon, the weapon is lost. If destiny = 0, the starship or character with the weapon is also lost. CCT will typically play more unpullable, destiny 0 locations than most/all other DS decks. As a result, there will be games where your deck still has these destiny 0 cards in reserve at later stages in the game. For example, you might not pull all your locations against decks that give a lot of activation, like Diplo, or in games where you needed to pull something else over your locations. These floating 0’s can be turned from a detriment to a strength by including Overload. For example, during a battle CCT players can draw a 0, redraw it with Tarkin (V), and then track the 0 for an Overload on their next turn.

• Isard – character: A spy who can break cover of an opponent’s undercover spy. Also, while with an unfrozen captive, she adds +2 to attrition against your opponent at all locations. Imperial leader who can add a battle destiny with Tarkin (V). In CCT decks that otherwise lack a spy and have cut carbon-freezing for help with winning battles, Isard is excellent.

• Broken Concentration + R’tic H’weel – effect + character: Broken concentration allows you to use 2 of your force to move the top card of an opponent’s force pile on their reserve deck. While at a Tatooine battleground, R’tic allows you to use 1 of your opponent’s force per turn as long as it isn’t their last force. Both of these cards can be used in conjunction with Greedo (V) and First Strike to further limit the number of weapons or interrupts your opponent can use during battle.

• Imperial Decree (V) &#8211; effect: Reduces some forms of force loss by the number of battlegrounds you occupy. In CCT, this is mainly used to reduce force loss from There is No Try and Weapons Display (V). There is No Try is the defensive shield that causes force loss on successful sense attempts. Weapons Display (V) is the shield that causes force loss when a character is excluded from battle. In some versions of CCT, such as those playing 2-3 Senses, 2-3 Stunning Leaders, and a You Are Beaten, Decree (V) can potentially prevent a loss of 6-8 force from LS shields.

* * *

### Cards to look out for and their counters

• Jar Jar Binks (the most thematic aspect of CCT is being annoyed by Jar Jar)  
o Deploys like a spy and can attack IG-88. During battle, he can target IG-88 for 1 force and draw destiny. If that destiny +2 is greater than your destiny, both characters are lost. Decks that play Jar Jar, namely LS mains, will have a high probability of drawing high enough to kill IG-88.  
o Counters: Barrier Jar Jar or Stunning Leader the battle and then clear him with either Force Lightning lost or using a weapon with Dr. Evazan during battle.

• Strangle: Targets an escort alone with a captive and draws destiny. If their destiny + captive’s power > escort’s ability and power, escort is lost. Since IG-88 has no ability, it’s almost guaranteed Strangle will kill him.  
o Counter: Strangle only works when IG-88 is alone. Once he’s with another character, Strangle is useless.

• Impressive, Most Impressive (V): Cancels Barrier or Stunning Leader when those cards are targeting a Jedi. Immune to sense. This deck often depends on Stunning Leader not being cancelled. A sense immune canceler is not a card you want to see.  
o Counter: Impressive, Most Impressive is unique and Stunning Leader is not. One counter is to watch your opponent cancel one and to play a second Stunning Leader. Similarly, Impressive, Most Impressive can sometimes be baited out with a Barrier on a Jedi. Once they&#8217;ve cancelled the Barrier to allow their Jedi to battle, they might not be able to cancel Stunning Leader.

• Clash of Sabers: Opponent can prevent one character present with their lightsaber user from battling or moving until the end of their next turn. Usually, this will be used on Maul and sometimes on Dr. Evazan depending on the situation.  
o Counter: Sense their Clash, Stunning Leader the battle on their turn (if they used Clash on your turn), or move the non-Clashed characters away while the Clashed character, who they can’t battle, blocks their drain.

• Evacuation Control (V): Opponent can play this effect, stack 3 cards from reserve deck onto the effect, and take 1 of these cards into hand during battle to limit both players to 1 BD draw and prevent all BD modification. This prevents Tarkin (V), Boba Fett, and I Have You Now from adding destinies, as well as completely neutering CCT&#8217;s BD draw-dependent space.  
o Counter: There&#8217;s no way around this. If a game needs to be won with overflow, Evac will sometimes need to be forced to be used before overflow can occur.

### The “I didn’t get IG-88” problem

• Compared to using <a href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/anymethodsnecessary.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Any Methods Necessary</a> (AMN) as your starting interrupt, which guarantees IG-88 (V) at the expense of hand-size, the 12 card start is an extremely greedy opening. The start can range from extremely good to extremely bad. When it’s good, it gets you IG-88, more activation, more characters, and more interrupts than AMN. When it doesn’t get you IG-88, there are&#8230;

**Two alternatives to deploying IG-88 (V)**:  
• _Deploy a different character to the Security Tower to prevent the captive from being released_. The Emperor is ideal for this with Dooku being good as well. Both the Emperor and Dooku increase your activation with their Dark Jedi Master icons. On subsequent turns, the Emperor can pull Force Lightning to see if you activated IG-88 in order to obtain him with Force Push (V). Since Force Push (V) requires putting two cards from hand into your force pile, Force Lightnings can used for this when your hand no other useless, high destiny cards to put back instead.  
• _Dare your opponent to release the captive by not deploying anything to the Security Tower_. This play is most common when you get multiple characters, a sense, and locations in your starting hand but no IG-88 (V). It can work because it costs the LS player 3 force to release the captive in addition to the cost of deploying and maybe moving the character they&#8217;re using to control the Security Tower. These expenses leave the LS player with little force, no draws, and two generally lesser characters who are ripe for a beat-down.

### Match-ups

**Common match-ups**:  
• Control decks  
• Mains decks  
• Space decks  
• Auto-flip decks

_Control Decks_: Control decks aim to generally control their own locations and win primarily through force drains.

Popular Control Decks:  
• Watch Your Step (WYS)  
• Quiet Mining Colony (QMC)  
• Diplomatic Mission to Alderaan (Diplo)  
• Echo Base Operations (EBO)  
• Old Allies (OA)

[size=150]Watch Your Step (WYS)[/size]  
• WYS is a deck relying on smugglers and usually Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight (LSJK) with A BUNCH of powerful interrupt cards.  
• Their space is strong, efficient, and generally best avoided.  
• Their Luke is a monster who can repeatedly evade beat downs, aid the battles of other characters, and deliver beat downs.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What WYS does well against CCT:[/b]  
• When WYS flips, they prevent sense and alter from being played. Also, they can replay interrupts from their lost pile once per turn. This combination of being able to replay cards and removing sense as a way of cancelling them makes WYS very potent against aggressive decks.  
• Against CCT, WYS typically wants to spread out and either cancel or avoid battles to both slowly drain you to death and also setup potential counterbattles of their own with LSJK.

[b]What CCT does well against WYS:[/b]  
• Like CCT, WYS is a deck that often functions by being able to get its key tricks faster than its opponents. It accomplishes this by using control/tunnel vision (and replaying it from lost pile with their objective) and/or used pile pulls from I Must Be Allowed to Speak (V). CCT, however, tends to get its trick even more effectively than WYS. Games can often be won with overflow through having had a counter to each of their defensive cards.  
• Stunning Leader is a huge bane to WYS. Other than the Lars Moisture Farm, every battleground site in the game will be an interior site. As a result, this allows CCT players to control when battles are occurring for a substantial advantage, such as preventing Lando (V) from nullifying Maul.  
• WYS will typically play one spy (K2SO) or no spies at all. As a result, IG-88 can pull locations and aggressive cards in the earlier goings with little worry of being attacked.  
• CCT is less affected by WYS’s force choke. WYS, when flipped, limits activation at non-battleground locations to 1 icon each. Against decks like HD and BHBM, this can be game-breaking. CCT, however, plays three 2/1 battlegrounds and will typically only lose 2-4 icons from WYS being flipped.  
• CCT easily sets up and protects resistance and Search & Destroy to nullify and out-damage the Kessel drain.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Generally avoid space. Once they&#8217;re flipped, they can play Moving into Attack Position repeatedly to make their ships immune to attrition while protecting it from sense. The space in CCT is very light, low in power, and often relies entirely on clearing ships with attrition. They counter attrition with ease.  
• Kill Luke. This is much easier said than done. WYS decks will often play multiple Dodges and a Blaster Deflection or 1-2 Jedi’s Concentration.  
• Dodge gives them the option to either make a weapon likely miss or to run away from the battle entirely. To counter this, it’s extremely important to find Ghhhk/Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us because it can cancel the move function of Dodge. Kir Kanos (V) can cancel both functions of Dodge as well. Myn (V) can place their Houjix, Run Luke Run, or Blaster Deflection out of play to greatly aid future battles.  
• When attempting to hit Luke with weapons, it’s important to use more weapons than necessary. If he can cancel two attacks, then you need at least three. If he can cancel all weapon attacks, Luke can still be killed with multiple battle destinies.  
• If you kill Luke twice, it’s usually game. WYS has no other characters who can successfully battle against CCTs many weapons and ability to delete characters with Dr. Evazan. If they try to satisfy Battle Order and prevent Search & Destroy without Luke, it can get ugly fast.[/spoiler]  
[size=150]Quiet Mining Colony (QMC):[/size]  
• QMC generally wants to hold Bespin and spread out with a bunch of cheap, weaker characters in order to maximize their drain damage and retrieval from Cloud City Celebration.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What QMC does well against CCT:[/b]  
• Like CCT, QMC is able to flip and pull cards from their force pile. This creates an interesting dynamic where both players have the same access to their tricks in a game that will likely be decided by those tricks.  
• Releasing the captive and/or pressuring IG-88 (V) with Path of Least Resistance (Path). Path allows the LS player to move one character from one mobile site to another. As a result, they can move any character they have into the Cloud City Security Tower. If you don’t get IG-88 (V) out turn 1 with a card to defend him, QMC can cause serious problems.

[b]What CCT does well against QMC:[/b]  
• QMC often relies on deploying Harc Seff in the Overseer to flip their objective, activate more force, and increase your deploy cost to Cloud City. Typically, he might not be defended with more than a single Imperial Barrier or Alternatives to Fighting. As a result, if these cards can be canceled, CCT can slow QMC dramatically by killing Harc Seff early with an Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle or Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and destiny adders.  
• Although QMC is able to pull its tricks with equal ease, they’re a deck forced to play cards to withstand pressure at both Bespin and at their sites. Although they have tricks and access to them, they often don’t have as many on the ground as CCT does. QMC often can&#8217;t continually withhold the ground-heavy design of CCT.  
• QMC’s characters are generally low or lower in defense value. When their tricks aren’t enough, their characters can be killed easily and often for substantial, game-sealing damage.  
• With the exception of the Cloud City docking bay, every site will be an interior site. Stunning Leader will allow most battling to occur when you want it to.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Kill Harc Seff early (with a barrier for Home One) or ignore their space entirely.  
• Aim for overflow, not control. If a QMC player plays 3 different characters to 3 different sites, it’s typically more beneficial to attempt to battle only one of them rather all of them. When battling one drain away and ignoring the rest, it’s often best to attempt to only cause enough overflow to make them play their houjix while saving force and characters to cause overflow again on a subsequent turn. This is because fighting QMC is expensive. If ignoring their space, your characters will cost +1 to deploy each. If battling in multiple locations, this expense is made even worse by paying to battle. The drains may hurt you but not as much taking overflow after a houjix was already played.[/spoiler]

[size=150]Diplomatic Mission to Alderaan (Diplo):[/size]  
• Diplo involves taking a few turns to flip by moving the death star plans to Alderaan. After they will want to spread out on Tatooine to maximize their drain damage and bonus to total battle destiny granted by their objective.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What Diplo does well against CCT:[/b]  
• Diplo plays a variety of cheap spies. As a result, they can often pressure and even kill IG-88 (V) in the early goings of a game. Putting the Emperor with IG-88 (V) is usually necessary to prevent this.  
• Once Diplo gets rolling, they can repeatedly battle more efficiently than other LS decks. This is accomplished by using Mon Mothma to take characters drawn for destiny into hand and making their relatively weaker much stronger through building up a large battle destiny bonus.

[b]What CCT does well against Diplo:[/b]  
• Diplo plays low defense value characters and few counters to sense. As a result, CCT can operate on characters with Dr. Evazan with ease in order to cause overflow however many times is needed to win. Diplo puts so many cards on table that the overflow from a single battle can often be enough to seal a game.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Ignore their space and attempt to overflow characters on the ground until they run out of houjixes.[/spoiler]

[size=150]Echo Base Operations (EBO):[/size]  
• EBO starts slowly while building up extremely strong space with large drains. They can also satisfy Search & Destroy by using speeders, which also nullify the majority of your weapons.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What EBO does well against CCT:[/b]  
• EBO can easily out-damage carbon freezing and Search & Destroy once they’ve setup.  
• Similarly, EBO’s ground is typically very hard to overflow. They can potentially setup Bacta Tank, which, although expensive, can allow them to trade a single character for multiples of your until they win.  
• They often have enough ships to cover multiple systems while also dealing massive damage at those systems.

[b]What CCT does well against EBO:[/b]  
• EBO is slow. Although it’s possible for them to create death balls of speeders and starships that can’t be cleared, this takes time to setup. CCT, on the other hand, can often blow up EBO’s ground before it has time to become unstoppable.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Setting up resistance, often with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter at Nal Hutta, is necessary to reduce their drains.  
• EBO players don’t need to (and shouldn&#8217;t) go to ground against CCT unless Search & Destroy is damaging them. Thus, setting up S&D is crucial to give you something you&#8217;re able to fight.  
• Usually it’s good to save lots of force for a big turn. EBO generally can’t fits many cards like Imperial Barrier or Alternatives to Fighting. As a result, when they see a big force pile, they often need to defend what they&#8217;ve committed to table by deploying ships and characters pre-emptively. You want them to deploy ships defensively because this will reduce the number of cards they will have to attack Zuckuss and prevent Resistance.  
• Similarly, since EBO generally shouldn’t go to interior sites to fight CCT, the characters used to setup S&D often need to be the less important characters, like Myn (V) and Mara. IG-88 (V) is often safe at the Carbonite Chamber by himself with just a couple barriers or a Stunning Leader to protect him.  
• If you maintain resistance and kill their ground, you win.[/spoiler]

[size=150]Old Allies (OA):[/size]  
• Old Allies is an extremely defensive control deck seeking to control Jakku, deal modest drains, and reduce one source of control phase damage to 1 (including Carbon Freezing!)  
• Starts with a free, unpiloted Falcon that can play as both a combat vehicle as well as a starship.  
• Has significant deployment restrictions (no Lukes or Jedi) that typically forces most OA players to rely more on pilots, speeders, and General Leia.  
• Can pull Rey from reserve deck and will typically start with effects allowing them to quickly deploy Profundity, General Lando, and General Leia.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What OA does well against CCT:[/b]  
• When flipped, which OA does relatively easily against CCT, they can reduce Carbon Freezing&#8217;s damage to 1 as well as reduce a destiny during battle by 2 once per battle (as long as a resistance character is in the battle).  
• Due to the destiny reduction, OA&#8217;s strength is resisting pressure mainly by making CCT&#8217;s weapons miss.  
• OA generally involves a variety of defensive tricks, like Control, Alter, Keep Your Eyes Open (V), I Can Take Care Of Myself, They&#8217;re Tracking Us (V), sometimes multiple Wesas, and sometimes more. Additionally, there&#8217;s usually 2 Solo&#8217;s and his ability to replay an interrupt from lost will usually come into play and come into play early.  
• OA has enough space and it&#8217;s strong enough to potentially occupy both Nal Hutta and Jakku to lock CCT out of space.  
• Combined Fleet Action, if played, is amazing against CCT as it will prevent multiple BD draws on Jakku sites. When used in conjunction, with Wedge, RSL, this can give the OA player a site that can&#8217;t be contested at all. Fortunately, Combined Fleet Action is played less than decks playing General Leia and more tricks instead.

[b]What CCT does well against OA:[/b]  
• Dominates interior sites. With mostly pilot characters, OA can do little to contest interior sites. As a result, pressuring IG-88 is generally not a great option &#8211; even if he&#8217;s alone. Similarly, a potential drain at Rey&#8217;s camp also can&#8217;t generally be fought.  
• OA typically gives 4-5 icons and either makes it less necessary to pull locations or provide the potential for huge activation early on.  
• With being unable to deploy Luke, OA can&#8217;t prevent Arica&#8217;s retrieval without killing her.  
• An early Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle with Emperor and Tarkin (V) can clear their Falcon and make for a very one-sided game.  
• If playing speeder hate, IG-88 allows CCT players to put it together more easily than other DS decks.  
• Carbon Freezing forces the OA player to deploy in order to flip before being able to stack defensive interrupts.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• OA typically has an answer for just about everything a CCT player can do. The main advantage CCT has is speed, gaining an advantage from an early battle, and pressing that early advantage until its impossible for the OA player to win.  
• With the exception of an early Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle to Jakku, the game is likely going to involve the CCT playing trying to kick the OA player off their sites.  
• First Strike is huge for limiting their ability to play multiple defensive interrupts during battle. The retrieval can also be helpful for mitigating force loss from the Jakku drain and There Is No Try  
• Myn (V) and your grabber can be used to prevent Solo from replaying a cancelled interrupt.  
• Stack weapons when battling because they&#8217;re very, very likely to miss.  
• Moving IG-88 to the Carbonite Chamber turn 1 can force Battle Plan and open up shield busting as an option (they&#8217;ll like want Aim High, There Is No Try, the grabber, and maybe Weapons Display (V)). When playing BF, BH, it&#8217;s better Perimeter Scan (V) is played to pull a shield rather than preventing BF, BH from battling.  
• The threat of Carbon Freezing prevents OA players from reducing any drains.[/spoiler]

\[size=150\]\[u\]Mains Decks:\[/u\]\[/size\] Mains decks will typically play multiples of Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight (LSJK) with other powerful characters and light space. Mains decks seek to win through repeatedly draining for 3+ with LSJK and/or fighting you head-on.

[u]Popular Mains Decks:[/u]  
• Throne Room Mains (TRM)  
• He is the Chosen One (Hitco)  
• Careful Planning (V) Mains (CPv Mains)  
• Yavin 4 Operations Mains (Y4O/YOps Mains)  
• There is Good in Him (TIGIH)  
• You Can Either Profit By This&#8230; (Profit)

[size=150]Throne Room Mains (TRM):[/size]  
• TRM is typically extremely ground heavy with multiples of LSJK, multiple weapon-wielding EPPs of their own, and a variety of interrupts to assist in winning battles &#8211; particularly against DS mains. At the time of this writing, it is the single most common LS deck for competitive play.  
• TRM is very dependent on getting out their locations early just as CCT is depending on drawing locations and/or getting IG-88. The match-up varies wildly depending on the quality of each players starting hand. At one extreme, TRM can win handily through releasing a captive we&#8217;re too force-choked to defend. At the other, CCT will essentially play wake-a-mole as TRM players hopelessly deploys their characters in attempt to set-up a drain only to see them battled away.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What TRM does well against CCT:[/b]  
• TRM goes first, sets up a large amount of activation quickly, and gives you no icons. This means they&#8217;ll be able to be highly aggressive on the ground while providing less time and resources than any other deck for a counterattack.  
• TRM typically starts Insurrection/Aim High and this takes away Elis in a match-up where Elis would be exceptional.  
• When playing Jar Jar and 2-3 spies, TRM is one of the most proficient decks at killing IG-88 (V). TRM takes the issue of &#8220;Should I pull activation or a card to defend IG-88?&#8221; and pushes it to its extreme.  
• LSJK and EPP Qui-gon are the two best characters against CCT 12 card mains. TRM will typically play 4-5 LSJK&#8217;s and 1-2 Qui-gons.  
• TRM can often get multiple uses of Impressive Most Impressive (V), Sorry About the Mess, Clash of Sabers, Dodge, and other detrimental interrupts through using Obi-wan (V), Solo, and Ounea Ta.  
• TRM can beat CCT in a &#8220;Sense war&#8221; and potentially cancel interrupts we depend on going through.

[b]What CCT does well against TRM:[/b]  
• CCT puts few cards on table and can generally take 2-3 drains from TRM before becoming crippled from their early damage.  
• If TRM attempts to drain at the Battle Plain, this can be countered by setting up Resistance at all your locations. As a result, it&#8217;s better for TRM players to occupy the Carbonite Chamber. This, however, means Stunning Leader can now be used to prevent an unfavorable battle, such as cancelling a battle after they&#8217;ve played Jedi&#8217;s Concentration.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• A typical start from TRM will have LSJK come to the Carbonite Chamber turn 2. Even if you have a chance of killing him immediately, such as throwing a Maul at him and hoping to draw high, it&#8217;s almost always best to wait because you want them to pay to drain at least once. The 3 force spent to drain means one less character to kill or potentially 3 less tricks in their hand to deal with later.  
• Against CCT, TRM often seeks to build-up a death ball of characters, many of whom are more effective than yours, while slowly putting the game out of reach with repeated drains of 3-4. As a result, they often can&#8217;t be cleared in a single turn but instead need to be &#8220;softened up&#8221; by either clearing several characters or forcing out most of the interrupts they have to defend their characters. The easiest way to soften up TRM&#8217;s characters is to deploy a single Maul with a Force Field (V) (or Sense) and Ghhk combo in hand and not battle. Force Field (V) or Sense would be used to prevent Maul from being killed by Sorry About The Mess. Since TRM has little or no way of dealing significant damage against CCT other than their drain with LSJK, they&#8217;re essentially forced to fight Maul. If they use Blaster Deflection and Dodge to protect characters, great. They likely won&#8217;t have these for the next battle. If not, Maul can take several characters with him or take his swings at LSJK to reduce their drain damage if buying time is needed. If needed, it&#8217;s sometimes possible to retrieve Ghhk combo with No Escape on your next turn in order to suicide another Maul.  
• Once TRM&#8217;s initial advantages have been mitigated and the game progresses, the game will come down to battles where you&#8217;re able to more consistently get the characters and tricks you need than the TRM player. If you can kick them out of the Carbonite Chamber, it&#8217;s usually a win.[/spoiler]

[size=150]He is the Chosen One (Hitco):[/size]  
• Like TRM, Hitco is typically extremely ground heavy with multiples of LSJK, some weapon-wielding EPPs of their own (they can&#8217;t play Qui-gon!!!), and a variety of interrupts to assist in winning battles &#8211; particularly against DS mains.  
• Hitco trades the speed of TRM for the potential to retrieve 1 force per turn with the 7 side of their objective and for a greater force drain with Prophecy of the Force.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What Hitco does well against CCT:[/b]  
• Hitco typically starts Insurrection/Aim High and this takes away Elis in a match-up where Elis would be exceptional.  
• Prophecy of the Force allows Hitco to deal greater damage with their force drain than other mains platforms.  
• Causing additional force loss from won battles with I Feel The Conflict.  
• Losing battles to CCT via a lack of an EPP Qui-gon.

[b]What CCT does well against Hitco:[/b]  
• CCT doesn&#8217;t need to fight Hitco&#8217;s LSJK. Hitco starts an interior BG site &#8211; the virtual Ewok Village. Unlike playing TRM who we are forced to fight out of lacking enough locations to setup resistance, this single interior BG site allows us to setup Resistance and protect all of our characters on the ground with Stunning Leader. Without EPP Qui-gon, Hitco is also much, much easier to counter-battle with Maul than other mains decks.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Concede the Carbonite Chamber if LSJK goes there and pull multiple defensive cards. Then, setup Resistance at the Audience Chamber, Nal Hutta, and the Ewok Village to force the LS player to attack. To further apply further pressure and really force the issue, deploy a spy to the JCC.  
• If you can prevent their battles, counter battle, and cause overflow before running out of Stunning Leaders and Barriers, it&#8217;s usually a win.[/spoiler]

[size=150]Careful Planning (V) Mains (CPv Mains):[/size]  
• CPv Mains will typically start Jakku with Rey&#8217;s camp or Tatooine with Shmi&#8217;s hut. Unlike TRM and Hitco, these decks will typically sport stronger space, rely less on early damage, and boast greater total activation.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What CPv Mains does well against CCT:[/b]  
• CPv Mains decks can punish CCT&#8217;s somewhat slower start by setting up massive activation. While TRM can initially be difficult to remove from the Carbonite Chamber but relatively easy to beat once they have been removed, CPv tends to be the opposite. CPv decks are generally more easily removed from their site(s) but are also able to use their greater activation to redeploy a greater number of characters.  
• CPv Mains decks typically play 2-3 of Rebel Leadership (V) and can combine this card with weapons defense to nullify almost all of your character removal. Additionally, this also means Obi (V) will likely hit the table and allow the LS player to more easily replay one the their powerful, anti-mains interrupts, like Clash of Sabers or Sorry About The Mess, from lost.

[b]What CCT does well against CPv Mains:[/b]  
• Although CPv has greater flexibility in how it can be played than a mains deck like TRM, it&#8217;s also less of threat in the early turns. With more time to setup, CCT can match up extremely well with CPv mains through getting more key cards before the first battles.  
• The system started by CPv players is often a liability as it gives your ZiMH a system to run away to while committing more heavily to winning on the ground.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• CPv space is typically 2-3 of Profunity, Falcon (V), and/or Home One. If Home One is deployed, it&#8217;s generally best ignored &#8211; even when it can be killed by, say, a loaded Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle. Unless making a riskier play, a Sense would be needed to cancel a Rebel Leadership (V) on Ackbar. Since Sense is going to be extremely crucial in battles on the ground, a Sense in hand is often better than having a system with their Home One in their lost pile. Sense is that important for helping produce a one-sided battle in your favor on the ground. CPv can be beaten easily without ever fighting it in space but it&#8217;s difficult to beat when unable to remove them from the ground.  
• Use the extra time CPv decks typically allow to thoroughly stack the cards need to beat them and beat them badly on the ground.[/spoiler]

[size=150]Yavin 4 Operations Mains (Y4O/YOps Mains):[/size]  
• It&#8217;s not a popular mains platform yet but it should become one. YOps Mains is essentially a better version of CPv mains decks. It boasts the same greater strengths in space as a well a large potential for activation. Unlike CPv mains decks, however, it sets up this activation without playing Speak With The Jedi Council and the Jedi Council Chamber. As a result, it has more room for extra tricks for battles, like Skywalkers with Bionic Hand (V) and is even more difficult to combat over a single site than CPv Mains decks.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What YOps Mains does well against CCT:[/b]  
• The extra card slots from not playing Speaks/JCC turn into cards a CCT does not want to see, like Alter (V), Control/Tunnel Vision, an additional Dodge, Blaster Deflection, or Jedi&#8217;s Concentration, etc.  
• Winning the sense war: YOps Mains relies on Control/Tunnel Vision instead of Threepio to get the cards it needs. As a result, a YOps Mains player can play more patiently and hold their Control/Tunnel Vision to cancel CCT&#8217;s Senses.  
• Destiny limiting: YOps mains will start Strike Planning to pull General Leia along with playing multiple copies of Rebel Leadership (V). With a high probability of drawing Leadership and being able to deploy General Leia or Obi-wan (V) with an early LSJK, destiny adders become much, much less viable as a way of clearing Luke early.  
• Bionic Hand (V) shenanigans: With being able to combine LSJK and General Leia relatively early on in games, YOps Mains is a prime deck for using Bionic Hand (V) to play and replay lost interrupts, like Skywalkers, Clash of Sabers, Dodge, and Control/Tunnel Vision. When playing Bionic Hand (V), YOps Mains can be especially difficult to remove from a site.

[b]What CCT does well against YOps Mains:[/b]  
• Although the space is relatively decent for a mains platform, YOps will deploy 2-3 systems total and struggle to defend them (typically plays Nar Shada and/or Endor (V) in addition to starting Yavin 4). If their space is heavier, they&#8217;re much easier to remove from the ground, and the match-up will be favorable. If their space is light, such as only a Home One and another ship, it then becomes possible to setup Resistance using two systems in space. This provides a way to win without needing to fight the LSJK/General Leia/Bionic Hand (V) death ball all game. The main limitation of Home One in YOps Mains is its hyperspeed of 3 means it can&#8217;t reach Endor (V) from Yavin 4, Nar Shada, or Nal Hutta and vice versa.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Setting up Resistance and ignoring the Luke/Leia/Bionic Hand death ball is possible, but it&#8217;s usually necessary to kill Luke to get rid of the Hand and his saber. This can take a pretty concentrated effort, such as taking one battle just to force out defensive tricks to setup a winnable battle on the next turn.  
• Can deploy a ship to Endor (V) and strand Home One there if it goes for the clear.[/spoiler]

[size=150]There Is Good In Him (TIGIH):[/size]  
• TIGIH starts with a Luke at Chief Chirpa&#8217;s hut and is typically very, very ground heavy. With the free Luke, TIGIH typically relies more on other Jedi for winning on the ground.  
• TIGIH gains an activation bonus of +2 at Luke&#8217;s location as long as there is no imperial at the the Endor Landing Site.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What TIGIH does well against CCT:[/b]  
• Starting with Luke already on table gives TIGIH players the chance to draw a sense in their opening hand and use it to cancel an early Force Push (V) for IG-88 (V).  
• Since it&#8217;s often best to not deploy an Imperial to the Landing Site and allow the LS player at least 1 turn of greater activation, TIGIH can gain a significant early activation advantage.  
• If playing Sai&#8217;tor with matching sabers, TIGIH has a huge potential for large force drains from a single site.  
• If we&#8217;re not playing You Are Beaten, we&#8217;re susceptible to taking force loss from Uncontrollable Fury when capturing Luke with Vader.

[b]What CCT does well against TIGIH:[/b]  
• Every battleground will be an interior site so Stunning Leader will always be in play.  
• Although TIGIH can setup a substantial drain that&#8217;s difficult to combat, the Endor Landing Site provides the additional location needed to setup Resistance when opting not to fight into their Jedi.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• It&#8217;s best to kill Luke rather than capture him. However, a good TIGIH player will not move Luke from Chief Chirpa&#8217;s Hut unless giving him up to be captured.  
• Mace and Qui-gon with matching sabers can be extremely difficult to clear. If they are cleared, those sabers are usually gone forever and any additional characters will be extremely easy to deal with.[/spoiler]

[size=150]You Can Either Profit By This&#8230; (Profit):[/size]  
• Starts with two Jabba&#8217;s Palace sites and a frozen Han as a captive. Han can be freed for a large amount of force retrieval as well opening up the opportunity to deliver direct damage during each control phase for each site occupied by one of their original trilogy main characters.  
• Typically relies on Master Luke&#8217;s, matching weapons, Lando With Vibro-Ax&#8217;s, etc.  
• Allows the CCT player to deploy up to 2 aliens for free at the AC.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What Profit does well against CCT:[/b]  
• Profit has an extremely potent late early/early mid game thanks to their used pile pulls from I Must Be Allowed To Speak (V). These pulls can be used for potentially blow-out battles at the AC and/or setting up a mob of characters that&#8217;s very hard to clear, such as multiple lightsabers with Obi-Wan&#8217;s Journal to cancel weapon destinies.  
• Although their ping damage should rarely exceed 2, it&#8217;s still free damage and capable of needling a CCT player to death.  
• Can mitigate early Carbon-Freezing damage with retrieval from rescuing Han.

[b]What CCT does well against Profit:[/b]  
• CCT can convert the AC turn 1 to immediately force choke the Profit player.  
• CCT can repeatedly clear Han Solo, flip Profit back, and remove their hopes of dealing meaningful damage.  
• Force Lightning is excellent against Proft. It can be played used to counter to Obi&#8217;s Journal or lost to clear Threepio early on or Solo later if needed.  
• Daroe (V) can be deployed at the start and pull 4-lom (V) for as well for instant recycling.  
• Profit usually has no answer for Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle and will struggle to get their ship and an ability 5 pilot to kill a ZiMH.  
• After the initial force choke, Profit typically struggles to fight off-Tatooine (no used pulls) and will struggle to prevent Carbon-Freezing.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Profit has a brief spike in its capability from the used pile pulls but then tapers off significantly against the force pile pulls of IG-88 (V). If you don&#8217;t get blown out from the battle after the pulls, this is a very favorable match-up.  
• Kill Han. Without Han on table, there&#8217;s no ping damage and Profit&#8217;s Tatooine drains are cancelled.  
• Deploying free characters at the start will depend on what aliens you&#8217;re playing. If deploying, one needs to be Mara since two lower ability aliens is just asking to be beat-up by Master Luke. Mara w/ saber, Daroe (V), and 4-lom w/ gun (V) is ideal. If not playing EPP Mara and Daroe (V), it&#8217;s better not to deploy free aliens.  
• Profit&#8217;s best card against CCT is Obi-Wan&#8217;s Journal. Pull Dooku and Force Lightning to counter it.  
• There&#8217;s no need to Carbon Freeze early since Han will likely be released (from conceding the Audience Chamber to them or with Someone Who Loves You) and most of the damage will be retrieved.[/spoiler]

\[quote=&#8221;tomtom&#8221;\]\[size=150\]  
\[u]Space Decks:[/u\]\[/size\] Space decks generally want to avoid deploying cards to sites and instead rely on large space drains and force retrieval to win games.

[u]Popular Space Decks:[/u]  
• Hidden Base (HB)  
• Yavin 4 Operations (Y4O/YOps)

[size=150]Hidden Base (HB):[/size]  
• Has several variations with most typically ignoring ground and attempting to win with drains at Kessel, drains at other drain 2 systems, and retrieval from Luke Skywalker (V) and/or Baragwins.  
• The most popular and strongest version is HB Quads which will either play Corellian Corvettes or Medium Bulk Freighters with Quad Laser Cannons and Corellian Engineering Corporation.  
• When flipped, HB can cancel up to 2 force drains and require spending 1 force in order to draw 1 card from force pile during draw phase.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What Hidden Base does well against CCT:[/b]  
• HB Quads can be extremely difficult and/or not practical to fight in space. Fighting them requires sensing multiple interrupts, like Power Pivot, On Target, Hit and Run, and/or Hyper Escape, which can cause more harm than good from force loss from There Is No Try.  
• Between Baragwin retrieval and Luke Skywalker (V), it&#8217;s possible for HB to easily out retrieve the modest damage of Search & and Destroy.  
• HB can drain for 3 at Kessel relatively quickly and possibly remove Search & Destroy, starships, and other important cards if top-decking cards to the force loss.

[b]What CCT does well against Hidden Base:[/b]  
• CCT sets up Search & Destroy with ease.  
• Carbon-Freezing gives CCT a huge leg-up in the damage race.  
• Arica (V) can be pulled by the Audience Chamber for early ping retrieval. She makes HB an excellent match-up for CCT.  
• Carbonite Chamber is a mobile site and thus, is immune to the force drain reduction from Projection of a Skywalker.  
• IG-88 pulls allow obtaining cards without having to pay force to draw.  
• HB Quads often doesn&#8217;t play another rebel in addition to Luke Skywalker (V) and thus, their second most important character for retrieval can be taken away by requiring him to be your captive.  
• Jabba&#8217;s Haven can be used to redeploy ZiMH or Maul&#8217;s ship to ensure systems are probed and/or to punish an HB player who spreads too thin.  
• If playing Something Special Planned For Them (V), Arica (V), and 4-lom (V), it&#8217;s possible to have unlimited ZiMH&#8217;s. This is done by retrieving ZiMH with Something Special at the end of an opponent&#8217;s turn and retrieving Something Special with Arica (V). On the next turn, you can get ZiMH with the IG-88 pull and get Something Special with 4-lom (V). This can repeated to deploy ZiMH every other turn for the rest of the game.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• The main way to lose is to run out of ships. Thus, it&#8217;s important to get No Escape and Jabba&#8217;s Haven to get back and redeploy lost ships.  
• Setup Search & Destroy very quickly. This is the main source of damage as drains will usually just be reduced and/or canceled. HB gives up a lot of icons and as a result, it is often better to use We Must Accelerate Our Plans to pull Search & Destroy than it is to pull the Blockade Bridge.  
• Do not deploy to space until their objective is flipped. With a limited number of ships, it&#8217;s important to save them for probing and satisfying Battle Plan and Resistance. Also, they cannot drain for more than 1 until flipped.  
• Once they flip, setup Resistance to mitigate the Kessel drain.  
• Typically, the necessary shields are Firepower (V), Battle Order, Secret Plans, and Resistance. Occasionally, Oppressive Enforcement can be good to counter the occasional Alter.  
• A relatively equal damage race favors CCT. Search & Destroy is free damage that can be maintained even as life force dwindles.  
• Do no move starships in front of their ships with starship weapons as they&#8217;ll likely be removed for free with Stay Sharp.  
• CCT&#8217;s Barriers in space can be game-changing. HB needs to put several ships on table to be able to cancel drains and deal damage of their own. As a result, it&#8217;s possible for them to run out of the ships necessary to clear ZiMH if the ships they do save for attacking are Barrier&#8217;d.  
• There&#8217;s only a small benefit to probing. You&#8217;ll likely only have a drain of 1 on the ground (thanks to Projection of a Skywalker at the Audience Chamber) and IG-88 really dampens the effect of needing to pay to draw. However, it&#8217;s still a benefit.  
• The Hidden Base will usually not be Kessel (because several DS decks will deploy there to stop the drain of 3) or any system used by other DS decks, like Bespin, Tatooine, Naboo, Endor, Hoth, or Jakku. It&#8217;s more likely to be Corellia, Anoat (V), Nar Shada, or Kiffex. However, HB players will also commonly know you know this and use unexpected systems as their Hidden Base.[/spoiler]  
[size=150]Yavin 4 Operations Space (Y4O/YOps):[/size]  
• Y4O generally plays as a space only or mix between space and ground. When flipped and a system has been liberated, they&#8217;re able to retrieve 1 force per turn (often in addition to Luke Skywalker (V) retrieval).  
• Y4O typically relies on matching ships and usually at least 1 X-Wing Laser Cannon.  
• The most popular version plays matching ships and EPPs. Typically, this version will play a ship very early to Nar Shada to threaten a drain of 3 with an initial force loss 1. Will Also play EPPs, Jedi&#8217;s Resilience, and 2 Clash of Sabers to potentially contest sites on the ground.  
• Some versions bunker Yavin 4 by creating a group of ships and a group of characters at the Yavin 4 system (with Haven) and the Yavin 4 Docking Bay.  
• Some versions play only space and use Haven to cheaply flood systems with matching ships (as well make it much easier to pay to drain in space).

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What Y4O does well against CCT:[/b]  
• X-Wing Laser Cannons are exceptional against CCT&#8217;s limited, low-maneuver starships.  
• Ello Nasty in his ship can kill ZiMH and prevent Resistance at little cost.  
• EPPs with Jedi&#8217;s Resilience can be problematic. They&#8217;re strong enough to force out defensive tricks and can get a leg-up in the damage race with the force loss from Weapons Display (V).  
• Can deal significant damage very quickly at Nar Shada.  
• Can easily out-damage and even retrieve through Search & Destroy.  
• Y4O usually has enough ships to contest all systems in play against CCT.

[b]What CCT does well against Y4O:[/b]  
• Setups up Search & Destroy with ease.  
• Carbon Freezing helps equalize Y4O&#8217;s early damage from Nar Shada.  
• Can pull Arica (V) with the Audience Chamber for ping retrieval (although its sometimes better to deploy her to the Yavin 4 War Room &#8211; namely she&#8217;s the only spy and you&#8217;re playing against a Y4O with Insurrection).  
• Can deploy a spy or Elis a character to the Yavin 4 War Room to help win a damage race.  
• Can clear several ships and even cancel Haven with an early loaded ZiMH or Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle.  
• Can block the Nar Shada drain with a cloaked Maul (and deal significant damage as well if playing Much Anger In Him).  
• I Have You Now is excellent against space Luke.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Block the Nar Shada drain with Maul or setup Resistance with ZiMH. ZiMH will need a lot of protection since Y4O usually has a wide variety of options for dealing with him. Greedo (V) can deploy as a react on ZiMH to eat the attrition +1 from a lone Ello Nasty in his ship. Projective Telepathy can often either cancel a battle or prevent a ship from being immediately lost to an x-wing cannon.  
• Sense will usually be needed for cancelling Clash Of Sabers if they go to ground with an EPP or two.  
• Can get a good trade against Luke in space with Vader, BF, BH, and I Have You Now.  
• If it&#8217;s a pure damage race, use their the Yavin 4 War Room and/or Boss Nass Chambers to increase damage and possibly setup a Stunning Leader counterbeat.[/spoiler]

\[size=150\]\[u\]Auto-flip Decks:\[/u\]\[/size\] Auto-flip decks are decks that don&#8217;t play a single rebel character. As a result, our objective will start flipped on the 7 side side. This presents several problems for CCT. Without a captive, IG-88 can no longer be used to pull cards from your force pile. Similarly, you no longer have a captive to Carbon-Freeze. Lastly, being auto-flipped means the Audience Chamber cannot be pulled for an initial boost in activation.

[u]Popular Auto-Flip Decks:[/u]  
• We Have a Plan (WHAP)  
• The Hyperdrive Generator&#8217;s Gone (Hyperdrive)

[size=150]We Have A Plan (WHAP):[/size]  
• WHAP is an Episode 1 Objective based on the retaking of the Naboo Palace Throne Room.  
• Has significant deployment restrictions and can only use aliens, episode 1 Jedi, and republic characters.  
• When in control of the throne room, WHAP deals 2 damage per battleground occupied by Padme or Panaka. Also, they gain the obtain to cancel any battle destiny >3 by spending 1 force.  
• Typically plays a variety of Naboo fighters and the Naboo system. There they have the potential to drain for 3 as well as remove CCT&#8217;s ships during their control phase with Lets Try Spinning.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What WHAP does well against CCT:[/b]  
• WHAP prevents IG-88 pulls and Carbon Freezing by not playing a single rebel. As a result, two of CCT&#8217;s significant strengths are removed before a single action has been taken.  
• Can more or less auto-win against CCT if playing Grimtaash and get it early when we&#8217;ve drawn very poorly in our starting hand.  
• Lets Try Spinning is very problematic for CCT&#8217;s space. Their strength in space generally requires CCT to contest WHAP on the ground where they are also very strong.  
• Fast damage: Deals damage extremely quickly with either the Naboo drain or flipping their objective and pinging.  
• Can play a variety of cards that make contesting the throne room difficult, like Disarmed, Sense/Alter/Control, Jedi&#8217;s Concentration, and Keep Your Eyes Open (V). The limited character selection means an additional EPP Qui-gon or two and more of these power interrupts will generally be played.  
• Jerus Janick can cover all battle damage and attrition from a battle. This is extremely powerful against a battle-oriented ground deck like CCT.  
• Padme raises the defense value of all republic characters with her and makes almost every WHAP character very hard to hit early on.

[b]What CCT does well against WHAP:[/b]  
• Turn 0 verify: By not having a rebel, WHAP also gives CCT a complete verify of their [i]entire[/i] deck due to occurring before starting hands are drawn. Although this hurts the effectiveness of CCT, it comes with a huge advantage of seeing exactly what you&#8217;re up against. If they&#8217;re not playing Grimtaash, the loss of IG-88 (V) is largely mitigated by being able to fearlessly drawing until you get everything you need (my record is drawing a hand of 28 cards against WHAP).  
• Flipping force chokes the WHAP player: CCT can gain a large activation advantage by allowing the WHAP player to flip (grants you another icon and removes 2 of their activation). When it comes to repeated battles over the throne room, this can result in be able to out-deploy and overwhelm a WHAP player. Force choke from First Strike, Projective Telepathy, and/or Greedo (V) further limits their ability to cancel destinies.  
• Offensive Stunning Leader: Stunning Leader can sepearate Jerus Janick, Sio Bibble, and/or Chewie with Bowcaster from the rest of WHAP&#8217;s characters. Dengar and Dr. Evazan & Ponda Baba can have a field day against any combination of those characters.  
• Potential to retrieve 2 force per turn: With being unable to play Luke, Arica (V)&#8217;s retrieval cannot be prevented. Starting on the 7 side of your objective means you can retrieve 1 force per control phase. Although this will typically be prevented with Simple Tricks And Nonsense while the throne him is the place of contention, it will become extremely helpful if able to win the battle for the throne room. In that situation, the WHAP player is forced to spread out elsewhere and may struggle to out-damage this retrieval &#8211; especially when its combined with Arica (V).

\[b]General strategy:[/b\] (assuming no Grimtaash)  
• Generally ignore space until the very late game.  
• Barrier Amidala during LS turn 1 in order to kill her turn 2 or LET THEM FLIP!  
• If letting them flip, draw a bunch of cards. It&#8217;s important to find your locations and stack the cards need to clear or block the damage at the throne room. These cards are mainly Stunning Leaders, weapon users, Dr. E, ghhhk (for suiciding Maul), and senses.  
• If playing 4-lom (V), it&#8217;s extremely important to find him. When drawing a big hand and taking early ping damage, it&#8217;s possible to drastically raise the destiny average of your reserve when it comes time to fight. This is going to be needed because CCT often cannot afford to miss against WHAP.  
• If playing Point Man (V) instead of 4-lom (V), it is often best to save it for setting up some high destinies later in the game than it is to pull an important card early in the game.  
• Jerus Janick will need to be removed before significant damage can be done. Use Dr. E, Force Lightning lost, or swing at Janick when suiciding a Maul with Ghhhk.  
• Don&#8217;t play Elis unless previously seeing Quite A Mercenary was in their reserve.  
• If possible, use Stunning Leader offensive with Dengar and Dr. E to kill Janick and potentially cause overflow or force a Houjix.  
• If they camp the hallway and instead try to win with the Naboo drain, try to setup Arica (V) and/or Search & Destroy to force them to take a battleground site. When combined with the retrieval from the objective, they&#8217;ll need to do more than drain at Naboo (even if draining for 3).  
• It&#8217;s possible to start very, very slow against WHAP. When this happens, it&#8217;s sometimes important to stall the match-up as much as possible as you draw into what you need. The match-up can be stalled mainly through using Stunning Leader. WHAP can&#8217;t ping without control. Thus, deploying characters to block Amidala and Stunning Leader the battle can allow you to build up a large number of characters while preventing ping damage. This leaves you vulnerable to Sorry About The Mess but Sense and/or Force Field (V) will minimize this issue.  
• No Escape can be huge for getting another use out of Stunning Leader or Ghhk.[/spoiler]

[size=150]The Hyperdrive Generator&#8217;s Gone (Hyperdrive):[/size]  
• Hyperdrive is an episode 1 deck seeking to deploy Obi-Wan, Padawan Learner (V) to Watto&#8217;s Junkyard.  
• Has numerous benefits tied to the Junkyard: an activation bonus of +2 and the ability to pull any card they want from their reserve deck after winning a battle or completing a force drain there.  
• Has deployment restrictions allowing them to only deploy aliens, Republic characters, and Episode 1 Jedi.

\[spoiler\]\[b\]What Hyperdrive does well against CCT:[/b]  
• Hyperdrive is restricted from playing rebel characters and will remove IG-88 (V)&#8217;s pulls as well as Carbon Freezing through lack of a rebel from the get go.  
• Can successfully bunker the Junkyard and force drain for more than enough to out-damage CCT and force us to fight over the Junkyard against their best characters.  
• Typically plays a variety of very effective interrupts for successful early battles, like 2x Sense, 2x They&#8217;re Tracking Us (V), as well as sustaining the Junkyard with Old Ben.  
• The Junkyard is an exterior site and Stunning Leader cannot be used to avoid unfavorable battles there.

[b]What CCT does well against Hyperdrive:[/b]  
• Turn 0 verify: Due to the lack of a rebel, CCT gets a verify before the game begins. From this, we can see if there&#8217;s a Grimtaash and what interrupts we will need to counter. If there&#8217;s no Grimtaash, we can draw large hands to ensure we&#8217;re able to cancel their Senses, Old Bens, etc.  
• Maul is immune to attrition: Before flipping, Hyperdrive makes Maul immune to attrition. With a 12 card start and 2-3 Force Pushes, it&#8217;s extremely like to be able to deploy Maul turn 2 to kill an early Obi-Wan to gain a substantial early advantage.  
• Typically wins in space: Hyperdrive&#8217;s space is typically only a Ric Olie in Queen&#8217;s Royal Starship and maybe an Accilmater Class Assault Ship. ZiMH with destiny adders or an Emperor&#8217;s Shuttle can beat this easily.  
• Potential for 2 retrieval per turn: Without Luke, Arica (V)&#8217;s retrieval cannot be cancelled. Combined with the retrieval from CCT&#8217;s 7 side, a Hyperdrive player generally must win the fight for the Junkyard in order to win.  
• Force Lightning: If the Emperor can be deployed to the Junkyard, it is extremely difficult for Hyperdrive to win the Junkyard. Force Lightning can delete Chewie with Bowcaster and Lando with Vibro-Ax as well make it extremely likely Mace-Windu (V) and Master Qui-gon (V) are able to be hit with weapons.

[b]General strategy:[/b]  
• Win the Junkyard. There&#8217;s really no need to do anything else as Hyperdrive&#8217;s entire strategy revolves around possessing the Junkyard.  
• Commonly better to be more aggressive than patient because although CCT can take the drain damage, the cards pulled when draining will quickly become a problem for CCT. Nevertheless, if we don&#8217;t see a Grimtaash with our verify, we&#8217;re also able to draw a large hand in order to help ensure we&#8217;re able to win the war of interrupts.  
• If the Junkyard gets cleared once, the loss of the +2 activation bonus is often enough to make it improbable to retake the Junkyard.[/spoiler]

\[size=150\]\[u\]When does the meta favor CCT?\[/u\]\[/size\]

CCT excels when the meta forces LS players to play relatively similar cards for their ground. This simplifies the cards you need in order to win on the ground. The strongest LS ground packages will currently use either mains or speeders. As a result, what CCT players don&#8217;t want is a meta where speeders and mains are equally viable. When we need to include cards for both mains and speeders, we risk being spread thin on what we&#8217;re attempting to counter.

Currently, we&#8217;re in a meta favoring CCT &#8211; largely thanks to the strength and popularity of I Want That Map (Map). Map makes Old Allies (OA), the most difficult speeder deck to combat, mostly unplayable as a deck for general competition. This is because Map deals significant early damage and can potentially overwhelms their speeders with its speed and power during the early game. As a result, CCT players can currently build decks with little or no counters to speeders and generally focus on winning battles against mains &#8211; a meta heavily favoring CCT.
