Greetings, Star Wars players!

Sorry for the delay in this post.  When Kevin asked me if he could spoil some cards, I wanted to give him some exclusivity on them, so I intended to post this last Friday, but work and travelling got in the way of things.

So let&#8217;s get some official text in front of you for the spoilers from Kevin&#8217;s show, and then let&#8217;s talk maintenance cards.

> Perimeter Scan (V) 4  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Hoth &#8211; C2]  
> USED OR LOST INTERRUPT  
> Text: USED: Play a Defensive Shield from under your Starting Effect. [Immune to Sense] OR Target opponent&#8217;s just deployed [Maintenance] card. Target may not battle (or allow opponent to \/ cards) this turn. LOST: Unless targeting your spy, cancel Force Lightning or Trample.

> ComScan Detection (V) 4  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Hoth &#8211; C2]  
> USED OR LOST INTERRUPT  
> Text: USED: Play a Defensive Shield from under your Starting Effect. [Immune to Sense] OR If opponent just deployed a [Maintenance] card, it may not battle for remainder of turn. LOST: Cancel Out Of Commission (unless canceling a hologram) or Clash of Sabers.  
> Set Icon 1

Now, I call this &#8220;official&#8221; text since that&#8217;s what&#8217;s currently on the master list.  But I&#8217;m comfortable saying that these will be changing before our spoiler release, and maybe even more before the final release.

I have been reading through all the comments and I definitely appreciate the passion and the reaction they have been causing.  These are definitely the most controversial cards in the set, so it was good to get early feedback on them.

But what were we thinking?  To answer that, I need to go back in time to the Reset Task Force discussions.  One of our big questions was to see if we needed to counter maintenance cards in some fashion.  We ultimately decided to let the meta shake out a little before releasing any sort of counter.  Fast forward to Set 1.  Knowing this was passed along to us, in a sense, we wanted to debate what (if anything) we should do with them.

Our internal discussion mirrored a lot of what happened publicly.  Some wanted to shield them, some wanted to do nothing, some wanted the Immediate Effects back.  Shielding, if we are not de-facto banning them, I decided was off the table.  First, the Ref 3 cards are not consistent in how they impact the game, so any sort of shield would have to be somewhat convoluted to balance all of them, with redefinitions and the like.  If it&#8217;s too broad, or maybe even too simple, its would be as if they were just banned.  Also weighing in was that some people liked them and didn&#8217;t want to see them hurt drastically, as well as our desire to not errata Decipher cards unless as a last resort.  The legacy IEs had a lot of clunkiness to them, but to their credit they did have a reasonable impact.  One issue with shields is that all Maintenance cards would be affected, compared to the IEs, which affected mainly one card per game.

Ultimately, we decided to release 2 cards in the set for each side that would semi address Maintenance cards.  We didn&#8217;t want the interrupts to be instantly playable, but we did want them to be a valid option if someone feared playing against maintenance cards.  The &#8220;new&#8221; immediate effects, which have since been cut were redos of the anti Nabrun and Elis effects.  Here&#8217;s what one of them looked like:

> <del>•Where Are You Taking This Thing? [TBD (V)] 5</del>  
> <del>[Virtual Set 1 &#8211; TBD &#8211; TBD]</del>  
> <del>IMMEDIATE EFFECT</del>  
> <del>Text: If opponent just drew destiny for Nabrun Leids (or just drew a [Maintenance] card for destiny), deploy on table; destiny = 1 and stack that card here, face up. Elis Helrot and Nabrun Leids are canceled. Opponent may use 2 Force to place card here on bottom of their Used Pile. [Immune to Control].</del>  
> <del>Set Icon 1</del>

The main reason we cut these was that the Maintenance card text wasn&#8217;t great in testing, and that we weren&#8217;t convinced that we needed to answer the Elis/Nabrun questions just quite yet.  We felt that IAO and Insurrection were very popular still, so since we were not happy with either aspect of the card we decided to put them on the back burner.

So let&#8217;s shift gears and talk about the Interrupts.

Early on, the first two functions of each card were exactly as is.  The LOST portion I think was another USED option, something that let you stack or take a card off of Justice (V)/mirror.  Later on, we decided that we weren&#8217;t huge fans of some uncountered problematic cards for each side&#8230; that being Force Lightning and Trample.  For DS, it was always about countering an unlucky OOC.  At this stage, the text was different&#8230; the two DS Interrupts targeted did so only outside of battle, so during battle use of them was ok.  The DS one was a little broader, it protected against OOC but some other attempts from other cards (like RTPs 7 side) to mess with cards in your Lost Pile.

This is where we likely erred.  The results in testing were not what we wanted as far as meta impact, and so I suggested we broaden the lost functions a bit.  This I felt made the DS one a little more like the LS version, which always seemed stronger.  So I removed restrictions and added in the Clash cancel.

Jumping back to the Force Lightning text, which is probably the biggest source of complaints on these cards, I wanted to share why Dooku made it as is into the Base Set.  We had left in a LOT of cards to help QMC and WYS in early drafts of the set.  Dooku, we viewed, as more than a cool political inclusion was something that could help keep those decks in check if they got good.  Now, WYS has been somewhat DOA, but QMC is looking better at this time.  The text initially was meant to protect from out of battle removal, which could seem to be somewhat excessive with Dooku.

I do still like the Shield text, since I think in most cases it is inferior to Cold Feet/mirror, and that&#8217;s ok by me.  It&#8217;s situationally useful and it gives people another option in case they need to play Cold Feet to counter a card and not to pull a shield.

I really like the barrier text since I think it does counter maintenance cards in some of their most abused ways &#8211; hit and runs.  Overall, I will admit that it&#8217;s not a very good counter, but my dirty little secret is that I don&#8217;t think they need a very good counter.  I liked when Cam Solusar said that Lando Calrissian (V) is his favorite maintenance counter in the set &#8211; I think that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d rather see them countered in time.  At the same time, I don&#8217;t think they are ruining the game, either, at this time.  I wanted to give people who disliked them something useful that would hurt them in some instances and this does.  I would expect if these made it in (the barrier text) that I probably wouldn&#8217;t look to address Maintenance cards directly for some time.

To recap what&#8217;s happening with these&#8230; I don&#8217;t know just yet, but I do know they will be not released as is.  A lot of options are on the table, and you&#8217;ll have to stay tuned to find out what we decide to do.

=======================================================================

Let&#8217;s switch gears and give you some new spoilers!

First up, some hate for Security Precautions:

> •Anoat (V) [LIGHT]  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Dagobah &#8211; U]  
> LOCATION &#8211; SYSTEM  
> LIGHT (2): Force loss from Security Precautions is reduced by 3.  
> DARK (1): Unless a Star Destroyer here, Force drain -1 here.  
> \[Planet\]\[Parsec 5\]  
> Set Icon 1

Security Precautions is about as heavy handed of a counter as you can make for a deck.  And it really does keep Hidden Base out of the meta.  Some wanted it nuked, but I wanted to take a slower first step and mitigate some of its damage.  This system basically counts x4 to reducing your damage from Sec Pre.  I didn&#8217;t want to go further with respect to damage mitigation since HB should very much like A New Secret Base (V) and I&#8217;d not want to go too far, even if if means I kill this card later and obsolete it if I didn&#8217;t allow it to go far enough the first time.

> •Wooof (V) 3  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Jabba&#8217;s Palace &#8211; R]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 2 ABILITY 2  
> Text: [Pilot]3. Wooof may deploy with any cruiser using Combat Response. While aboard an [Independent] starship, subtract 1 from opponent&#8217;s battle and weapon destinies here.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 4  
> [Pilot]  
> Set Icon 1

This was a card that almost made the Base List, so we decided to take another crack at him.  He does have some similar text, but he also has some new text to help specifically against X Wing Cannons, which have a bad habit of eating up poor independent ships.

And finally, I wasn&#8217;t planning on this, but since someone asked for it, here&#8217;s a part of the new WHAP card&#8217;s I&#8217;ll reveal more about later on.  I&#8217;ll talk about this in more detail next time, so speculate away!

> •Naboo: Theed Palace Hallway (V)  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Theed Palace &#8211; U]  
> LOCATION: SITE  
> Light (1): Once per game, may /\ Ascension Guns. You may move here using landspeed for free.  
> Dark (0): While They Will Be Lost And Confused on table, this site gains [Dark Side].  
> \[Interior\]\[Planet\][Episode I]
