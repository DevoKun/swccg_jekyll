_&#8220;The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen.  Begun, the Clone War has.&#8221;_

The PC is excited to announce that the pdf for 9.1 &#8211; &#8220;Republic at War&#8221; is completed!  The new cards are legal immediately for casual and competitive play.  This is the first set in our V9 &#8220;Clone Wars&#8221; theme, and we think we&#8217;ve done a good job at capturing some exciting aspects from the prequels to expand the scope of what we can re-enact within the game we all love.  Several player created designs are also included in this set, to provide various help for new and existing deck.  W

Further, we want to thank you all for your patience.  The PC is aware that this set has taken more time than intended, but we&#8217;re dedicated to releasing the highest quality set possible, and wanted to get everything as ready, accurate, and balanced as possible.

The pdf can be found in the downloads section.  The cards will hopefully be in Holotable soon for your virtual use as well.
