<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Our rules advocate Aglets has recently updated the Cube list. The Cube, or Watto’s Chance Cube, as you may know, is our own Star Wars draft format system, in which players get to draft cards from a pre-selected card pool of 390 cards.</span>

The cube format has been kept updated since the reset, and now includes set 4 cards to reflect the current meta game and fan favorite cards of the Episode 7 movie. For LS you will find Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and of course the Episode 7 versions of Solo and Chewie, and for DS a healthy dose of Kylo Ren and his First Order lackeys for the DS. The location pool has also been reviewed and modified to support more battlegrounds, and therefore a more interactive gameplay.

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">For those of you not familiar with the Cube format, please do yourself a favor and try it out. It’s a fun experience and a nice addition to constructed tournament gameplay. </span>

Have fun playing and may the force be with you
