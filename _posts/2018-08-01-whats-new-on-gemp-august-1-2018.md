Greetings GEMPers,

We have a very good update for you to close out the month of July and kick off the August OCS &#8212; below are the 27 cards that are now available to use in GEMP:

Dark Side:

  * Apology Accepted (V)
  * Bala-Tik
  * First Order Special Forces TIE
  * Jedha: Jedha City
  * Krennic, Death Star Commandant
  * Lana Dobreed & Sacrifice
  * Lieutenant Venka (V)
  * Mustafar: Vader&#8217;s Castle
  * Supreme Leader Snoke
  * They Will Be No Match For You (V)

Light Side:

  * Admiral Raddus

  * Galen Erso
  * General Kenobi

  * Scarif: Landing Pad Nine (Docking Bay)
  * Taidu Sefla
  * Yavin 4: Massassi Ruins

Still remaining to complete from Set 9 includes They Have No Idea We&#8217;re Coming and related cards, Red 5 (V), Commence Primary Ignition (V) and related cards, and a few other standalone cards. Some of these (particularly Red 5 (V) and Stardust) have some complicated interactions that we&#8217;re working out, but the team is learning a lot through this process.

I&#8217;ll also take this space to announce that Tom M, better known as hyvee_doughboy, has joined the GEMP development team! You all likely know him from the work he has done in the past for V-kit, the tournament software, Scomp Link Access, and many more important projects to the PC.

I hope the next batch we release will include all of the remaining Set 9 cards, but until then we hope you enjoy the above cards!

MTFBWY,
