Greetings, Star Wars Players!

With Set 1 under our belt, it&#8217;s time to talk a little about our next release, let&#8217;s call it Set 1.5 for the time being&#8230; our first all player created set!

The Player card developers have been working with a ton of player creators on new or makeup designs.  Their work has been slowly but surely filling up their own little master list and now it&#8217;s time for some testing.

The set size (based on if all the list were to make it) is pretty big, and I can&#8217;t say that all of the will be released.  I do think we are going to try and release as many as we can to both clear our some of the backlog but also as a way of saying thanks for bearing with us with the long awaited Set 1.  Things that will definitely affect what goes into the final set include multiple cards from 1 person (take your turn, dude!), LS/DS balance, and too many re-released cards.  Much like design sets, I feel that the player sets should promote the &#8220;new&#8221; while still having a few old cards in them.

It is our goal to have these cards ready in time for Worlds.  And that&#8217;s where you come in.  I got the Advocates to agree to let us undertake a grand experiment &#8211; completely public playtesting.  The Reset showed that there could be a lot of good stuff that comes out of community involvement, so we wanted to see if this would work for testing.  I&#8217;ve asked our current testing team to help be the backbone of this effort, but I am looking to hear from all players who want to participate.

It will work by creating in public some subforums dedicated to PTing&#8230; there will be a master list, a testing request/intent list, and places to report games and to discuss cards.  Since this will be all open, everyone, including the creators themselves can see how their card is being received.  We want honesty, so my deep suggestion is to NOT identify what card is yours if at all possible.  There will be harsh things said (you get a taste my world, heh!) but in the end if you take the criticism for what it is, you can end up with a stronger design.

Here&#8217;s the tentative schedule:

4/13ish &#8211; 5/11 Round 1 testing  
5/11 update 1 &#8211; 6/1 round 2 testing  
6/1 update 2 &#8211; 6/22 round 3 testing  
6/22 &#8211; whenever update 3, test till we are ready to release.

You&#8217;ll see we have at least 4 rounds of testing and 3 rounds of text revisions built in.  I&#8217;m hoping that having regular update times will be easier for all to digest.

If you are a player creator and your card is not on the list ready to test, don&#8217;t worry!  Keep working with the developers and let them know of your interest.  Much like in Design some cards could make it in update 1 that don&#8217;t show up initially.  At a certain point, I&#8217;m going to tell them to cut things off and you&#8217;ll have to wait for the next one.

As I told testing, this could be an epic fail, or it could be something really cool.  I&#8217;m excited to take this experiment with you and excited for you all to see these player cards and to learn more about the Development process.
