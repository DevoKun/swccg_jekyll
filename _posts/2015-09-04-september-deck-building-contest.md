Submission deadline  
All submitted decks must be received via PM to Advocate by 11:59 PM EST on 9/21 (no exceptions)  
Revisions are allowed until the deadline.  
Each player may only submit one deck for consideration.

All entries must have September Deck Contest in title.

Deck building restrictions:

Must intend to flip your objective  
Must have either the Sarlaac or Rancor/Rancor Pit in the deck.  
You do NOT need to list Shields in your decklist, but DO list your Starting Effect

Voting  
Voting will be divided into 3 sections.

Section 1 &#8211; Competitiveness  
Section 2 &#8211; Creativeness  
Section 3 &#8211; Quality of deck description/match ups

Each judge will be giving a 1 (low) to 5 (high) in each section.

The decks with the top three totals will be declared the winners.

In case of a tie, the higher score in Competitiveness will be the first tie breaker. If there is still a tie, we will then use Section 2 (Creative) as the next tiebreaker, then Section 3 (Quality of description/matchup) as the next tiebreaker. If we happen to still have a tie after that, we will flip a coin.
