Okay, so you’ve already made the decision to start down the path and learn the ways of the Force, now it’s time to try to get some x-wing flying action in and enjoy the game.

The best advice for a new (or returning) player interested in getting into Star Wars CCG is to [register](https://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-login.php?action=register) (for free) for the Star Wars CCG message boards. On those message boards the community organizes events to play in, helps locate other players nearby and discusses the cards in general, including strategy and deck ideas, and can help you with any other questions you may have about the game. You can instantly go to the [Player Locator thread](https://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=348&t=56943) and try contacting players in your state or make a post in either the [General Discussion](https://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=2) message board and I can guarantee players will gladly help you out (unless you’re the kind of person that roots for Sebulba… that’s boring since he always wins).

**_The Quick and Easy Path…_**

Of course, if you want to start playing (for free) right away, there&#8217;s always online play. Information about playing Star Wars CCG online can be found [here](https://www.starwarsccg.org/community/online-play/).

**_So how do you get the cards?_**

As fun and convenient as online play can be, the back bone of Star Wars CCG is the interaction between you and the person sitting across an actual table from you. For this, you will need cards.  As mentioned earlier, this community is generally very welcoming and you will probably have no trouble borrowing a deck from someone or even just borrowing a few cards you may need for a deck you have mostly built.

However, in the event you decide you want to start building (or starting) your own collection, you can get most of the cards you’d need pretty inexpensively, so long as you do it smartly.

Players who are looking to start up their collection would be wise to scour eBay for old player’s collections or try to find another “veteran” player nearby who can help him get the most bang for his buck by giving him advice on which cards to buy.  Occasionally former players will be looking to unload decent sized collections on the [Star Wars CCG Trading Boards](https://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=359).  These are always good places to start and are usually the quickest, easiest and cheapest way of getting a solid base of cards to build your decks with.

Once you have a solid base of cards, there may come a time when you are looking through your collection and realize you need a few more cards. Whether it’s because you like the collectable aspect of the game or just want to make sure you have an entire arsenal at your disposal so that you can always have whatever cards you may decide you need, building a decent collection for this game is not that hard &#8211; you just need to be smart about it.  And eventually as you continue amassing your Star Wars CCG collection and you’ll find that you can compete card-for-card with even the most hardened Jedi in no time.

**_She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts…_**

Decipher had a habit of printing and re-printing cards fairly often. This also helped to flood the market with a lot of cards and keep costs low for players now. For example, take the Han Solo card from the first set, Premiere.  It was initially among the hardest cards to get as so few were printed because, like the other main characters, it was printed with the scarcest rarity.  However, a few months after that set was released, Decipher re-printed the entire set, but with a white border on the edges of the card.  This more than doubled the available Han Solos available to the players because the white bordered printing was “Unlimited.”  So these cards were not only released through booster packs, but also re-released through other products and made very plentiful.  In fact, a few years later, Han Solo was re-re-released as a foil card.

So now there were three different versions, all of the same exact card. While most players agree that the white border cards do not look as good as the black border cards &#8211; they all play the same way and do the same things in the game &#8211; the black border Han Solo has the same power, ability and game text as the white bordered one and the foil. However, their values can vary greatly.  So, **pro-tip**: especially when you are first starting, purchase your cards regardless of the border or foil-status and just go for the cheap version!

**_Wait, what???_**

<img class="wp-image-7218 size-medium alignleft" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/HanSolo-300x137.png" alt="HanSolo" width="300" height="137" /> That’s right – a player who wants a Han Solo card has options and can look for the affordable version, without sacrificing any game play strength. So, be mindful, that cards from the Premiere set were printed with either a black border (for the limited edition versions) or a white border (for the unlimited edition). So long as you do not care about the appearance of your deck, the white border cards are generally much, much cheaper than the black border counterparts, despite being the exact same card in all other respects.

_Note: various other sets (A New Hope, Hoth, and Dagobah) were also released in White Border versions, however their run was not as prevalent as Premiere, so the white border versions from those expansions generally comparable in value to the black border versions. So you cannot always assume “white border is cheaper,” however a good rule of thumb is that with the original main characters, go for the white border versions – they are very plentiful and very inexpensive!_

_**Sets? Singles? Boxes?**_

As Decipher is no longer printing cards, the sealed product for this game is very finite and quickly dwindling. That makes it scarce and often times not worth the bang you can get for your buck, card wise. While opening packs of cards is fun, it is a novelty. So those on a budget should not pay for that novelty. More often than not, you can spend the money it&#8217;d take to buy a box of product in much more efficient ways to help fuel your collection.  For example, for the price of a sealed booster box of Premiere (which contains 36 packs, and therefore 36 rares), you could buy an entire set for Premiere (including all 108 rares). This formula holds true for nearly every set. For example, as of this writing, a sealed box of Reflections III (which would contain 90 premium cards) can cost about over $400 &#8211; which is about the price you would pay for about _four complete sets_ of the 100 premium cards from that set.

Another option to quickly build a collection is to buy cards by the set, to ensure you have every card released from that set.  This is generally not the most efficient way to build your collection, however it can be good to know you have even the obscure cards, in case a new idea comes to mind or the Players Committee makes one of those cards playable with a virtual card release.  For this practice, just be mindful of which sets you are buying.  Inexpensive sets (whether looking to buy packs or singles from) include Premiere (Unlimited), Cloud City and Jabba’s Palace. These sets were printed in large, large quantities and Decipher also released them through several different products that players purchased even long after the initial release of the set, so they are generally plentiful and inexpensive. On the other end of the spectrum, the more expensive sets include Endor, Death Star II, and any of the Episode I expansions (primarily Corsucant and Theed Palace), as well as Reflections II and Reflections III. Those expansions are very expensive to buy sealed product from, and many of the powerful cards can be expensive.

However, the good news is that the Players Committee is very aware of this and takes it into account when selecting which cards to make into new Virtual Cards.  Additionally, the Players Committee has released very strong cards on very common and inexpensive cards.  For example, Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Learner are both very strong cards that only require inexpensive common cards to use.

Overall, it is probably cheapest and most efficient to simply buy only those cards you need as singles.  This obviously limits paying for extraneous cards you may not need at the moment, letting you get straight to playing and deck building, giving you more time to build your collection.  Also, as you get more familiar with the game, you will recognize the cards that many players favor. There is a [very good list of “start up” cards](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=332&t=51974) that would be ideal in helping most players make any of the “competitive” decks that they want. _This list will be discussed in the next article as a quick, cheat sheet guide for players who have a base of cards already, to help focus their collections so that they will be able to make most any deck that they want &#8211; it&#8217;s posted here to show everyone that you don’t need thousands of cards to get into this game at all. In fact, you don’t even need all of the cards on that list (nor should you even try to get them all at first – that list is just a general list of those cards, that if you DID have them all, you would be in great shape to make whatever deck you wanted, whenever you wanted)._

**_Where do you go about buying <del>power converters</del> cards these day?_**

Check out [this page for some online stores](https://www.starwarsccg.org/newplayers) that sell Star Wars CCG cards.

## TL;DR:

  * Visit the [New And Returning Player](http://www.starwarsccg.org/newplayers) area of the website for more great resources and feel free to also check into the [New Player Forum](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=332) and the [General Discussion Forum](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=2) to ask any other questions.
  * When trying to build up your collection, aim for the white bordered versions. Sometimes the foil releases can also be cheaper – all of the cards play the same!
  * Generally, buying sealed product is never, _**never**_ a good investment. You can usually purchase the entire expansion set for less than the price of a booster box from that expansion
  * If you can’t find an auction or old collection to buy, you can always pick out a deck that interests you and go to an [online vendor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/online-vendors/) and buy just those single cards you need for your deck, which depending on the deck may not be that expensive at all, yet give you an instant ability to play a competitive deck.
  * Feel free to explore your interests and remember you don’t need every card right away. You can take your time building it up. This [list](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=332&t=51974), as well as the next article, will help you focus on which cards you should try to get, both to have a good core set available to you, and which cards you may need if want to play a certain deck type or re-live your favorite moments in the movie by playing them in the game.
