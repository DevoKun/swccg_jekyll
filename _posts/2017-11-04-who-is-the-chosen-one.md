**Who is the Chosen One?**

A big part of the Star Wars saga is “the Prophecy of the Force.” However, despite being the driving force (pun intended) behind (at least) the first six films, there does seem to be some debate about exactly how – or thru who – the Prophecy is to come to be. A basic google search will bring up dozens and dozens of articles debating who the Chosen One is – Anakin, Luke, or even Rey or Kylo or Snoke or Jar Jar. Countless youtube videos have been created about whether or not the Prophecy is fulfilled by Anakin, Luke or maybe even both.

It’s an interesting topic for sure, and it’s time for the Star Wars CCG to weigh in on the discussion.

_**“You refer to the Prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it’s this… boy?”**_

In Episode I, we see Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn discover Anakin Skywalker – a Tatooine junkyard slave who was, as the story goes, conceived by the Force itself. Qui-Gon noticed incredible Jedi-traits in the untrained boy and presented him to the Jedi Council. Anakin Skywalker’s journey in the Force – and first steps towards fulfilling that Prophecy, began there, when the Jedi Council initially forbade his training, feeling that he was too dangerous. It was only thru <a href="https://youtu.be/ojXpHwhIqO8?t=64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qui-Gon’s insistence at his death that “He is the Chosen One… He will bring balance,”</a> that caused Obi-Wan to promise his fallen mentor that he would train Anakin in the ways of the Force.

Along the way there were certainly some bumps. In fact, Obi-Wan himself even began to question whether or not Anakin was the Chosen One, asking Yoda, “Is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?&#8221; To which Yoda responded that the Prophecy could have been misread. And, to say the least, it probably was.

After Anakin’s fall to the Dark Side and his slaughter of the Jedi – including the padawans – Obi-Wan declared to <del>Anakin</del> Vader that he WAS the Chosen One and that he WAS to have brought balance. But instead, he left the Force in darkness. So, with all of the galaxy’s Jedi and padawans (except Yoda and Obi-Wan) slayed, they had no choice but to put their faith in a boy – the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

Obi-Wan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeG215-yu-k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watched over that boy and protected him, convincing himself that perhaps the Prophecy was in fact misread and that Luke is indeed the Chosen One</a>.  After guiding Luke thru his discovery in the Force, Obi-Wan finally tells Luke what his destiny is – to kill Darth Vader. When Luke tells him he cannot kill his own father, Obi-Wan defeatedly acknowledged that they have then lost. However, Obi-Wan underestimated both Luke and Anakin because it was through Luke’s compassion – and his refusal to kill his father – that ultimately brought the Prophecy to its conclusion as Anakin Skywalker, redeemed by the actions of his son, killed Sidious and ultimately brought balance to the Force.

Such a great, iconic story and enthralling debate about which one of the Skywalkers was the Chosen One of the Saga. How all along, even after he betrayed and murdered so many of them, the Light Side of the Force still had this amazing tool in Anakin Skywalker to destroy the Sith but they needed his son to redeem him. How even though he was presently an agent of evil as Darth Vader, it was Anakin all along who would in fact destroy the Sith.

And in going through our cardpool, it almost seemed a Star Wars tragedy that there was not too much to represent this struggle of the lone, vanquished Jedi needing to re-reach Anakin. Sure, there is There Is Good In Him, an objective that shows Luke’s journey to redeem his father – by using Mace Windu and Qui-Gon Jinn to win battles. But where is the part where the Jedi are killed an on the run and need to reach out to Anakin? Where is the story of Anakin?

So, I present to you, the Saga of Anakin Skywalker – SWCCG-style.  
(usual caveat that it’s subject to change…)

<p style="text-align: left;">
  He Is The Chosen One<br /> <em>Deploy Jedi Council Chamber (with Prophecy Of The Force there), Ewok Village, and I Feel The Conflict.</em><br /> <strong>For</strong> remainder of game, you may not deploy [Episode I] Jedi (except Yoda) or [Episode I] padawans. Luke may not be captured by [DSII] objective game text unless with Vader during any move phase and two cards are stacked on Insignificant Rebellion.<br /> <strong>While</strong> this side up, you may initiate battles for free.<br /> <strong>Flip</strong> this card if a Jedi at a battleground site and no Dark Jedi is at a battleground site.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  He Will Bring Balance<br /> <strong>While</strong> this side up, once during your control phase, may peek at up to X cards from the top of your Reserve Deck, where X = number of battlegrounds you occupy; take one into hand and shuffle your Reserve Deck. During your draw phase, may retrieve any one card; opponent may stack a card from hand onto I Feel The Conflict to place that card out of play instead.<br /> <strong>Flip</strong> this card (unless Vader crossed over) if a Dark Jedi at a battleground site or you have no Jedi at a battleground site.
</p>

_So, lets start with…. The start._  
You get to play the place where Anakin started his journey in the Force (the Jedi Council Chamber) and the place where he ended it (as a Force ghost on Endor with his Force ghost-pals). You also get to start the Prophecy Of The Force [[previously spoiled here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1154101#p1154101) – but the Proofing Team and Graphics Design Teams have selected a great underlying card and a great picture for this card, yet to be revealed!]. Prophecy is an important mechanic of the deck, as (just like in the mooooovies), the player who controls the Prophecy has the potential to increase their damage output. But it can be very easily stolen from them by their opponent. All you need to do to seduce the Prophecy back to your side is exercise control over a location with Jedi-level ability, and the Prophecy will follow your will.

You also get I Feel The Conflict, which is the Light Side’s way of reaching out to Anakin.

_The characters you can use._  
The concept has gone thru a number of revisions along the way. Initially it’s intent was to be a mains deck to replace Throne Room which many felt was getting tired and old and also was somewhat unfair (literally breaking the rules of Star Wars CCG that the Dark Side goes first and that it never had to give up a battleground – or any Force to the opponent – unless it wants to). So originally, the only character restriction was that you could not play Anakin (more on that later). But as it went thru it’s changes and became more focused into what it is now (credit to the Development Team), it became this character base, which is both unique in SWCCG terms and iconic for the moment the deck represents. Anakin has just fallen to the Dark Side and killed Mace and the padawans and the clones have taken care of the other Episode I Jedi. So the Light Side is without any of their services. And while they hope to get Anakin back, the others are gone forever (although Kanan Jarrus is still hiding in exile!).

_No Anakin in a deck based around his story?_  
As far as Anakin – he has never been playable in this deck because… well, because he IS the deck! He turned to the Dark Side and you can use his aggression to battle for free while trying to bring balance to the Force. And once the Light Side rids the table of Dark Jedi, balance is temporarily restored, so the Jedi have a better view of the Force and can see it more clearly (ie, peek at their deck and use the Force to help them in their quests by getting new resources/cards). And, they can use the Force to heal and regenerate (get back any card they want – but beware, there is a risk that if the Dark Side – in it’s selfish nature – is willing to compromise its hold on Vader by stacking a card on I Feel The Conflict, that card is gone forever). That mechanic is doubly-interesting because while<img class="alignright" src="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/anakinskywalker.gif" alt="Anakin Skywalker Interrupt" width="195" height="273" /> when playing against Vader-less decks, it may not have too much of a drawback, those decks that do run him will have to worry about a rogue Anakin Skywalker Interrupt running their day! Just the same, as the Light Side, you have to be careful not to just always pick your best lost pile card because having the opponent place your Luke Jedi out of play can be a real bad day!

About that random rogue Anakin Skywalker interrupt. It’s certainly conditional, but imagine the glory if you pull it off! In fact, the text on Prophecy Of The Force &#8211; while it will most likely be used to get Anakin’s Lightsaber back into hand, what if it’s used to get back that interrupt? Scary situation for the Dark Side player to see you do that while Vader is sitting at the Back Door in their Hunt Down deck… Even better-imagine you do pull off the interrupt and cross Vader back to the Light Side. You then get to use Vader, who is now re-named Anakin Skywalker. Well,if you lose that character from table, Prophecy lets you take him back into hand and use again! And since he isn’t an Episode I Jedi or Episode I Padawan, you can re-deploy your copy of Anakin Skywalker!

All in all, we hope you enjoy the saga of Anakin Skywalker in SWCCG terms. Many playtesters have found it to be a fun, interactive battling deck. They have even changed how I have thought about the deck. I used to always call it the Anakin objective, but they have coined the cool term, HITCO, which flows very well. And – perhaps most importantly to Tom and me – finally there is a deck to start all foil locations! Yes!

Although, now that I look at that foil Ewok Village, that really should be re-done…
