**Welcome to Data Tapes** – an article series all about Star Wars CCG. Here I&#8217;ll be exploring a wide-range of topics related to our favorite game. I&#8217;m a returning player, but, I don&#8217;t intend to focus solely on NARP (new and returning player) content, though it might naturally end up happening the way. For now I&#8217;m keeping my options open! So I present to you a little introduction, and a league night write-up!

<img class="size-medium wp-image-10114 aligncenter" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/rey-214x300.gif" alt="rey" width="214" height="300" /> 

I’ve been playing a lot of the Star Wars CCG recently. I started playing this game when I was about 10 with my Dad, and have literally never found another game that I like quite as much. After years of turning cardboard sideways (playing Mtg) I got incredibly tired of it, and started digging through the old Star Wars collection, which piqued my interest, but at the time I just didn’t have the time or resources to get into the game. With the release of Ep 7 and the subsequent release of v-set 4, I was ready to jump back in. I was happy to see that the player committee had made a big reset of the virtual cards, which somehow made the game seem less daunting to get in to.

So for the past<img class="size-medium wp-image-10115 alignleft" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/anakinskywalkerpadawanlearner-214x300.gif" alt="anakinskywalkerpadawanlearner" width="214" height="300" /> couple months I’ve been really immersed in the game. I’m teaching my wife to play, reading/listening to anything I can find, and playing online as much as I can.  
Luckily, Endor region (WA) is home to some of the most supportive, awesome dudes in the Star Wars CCG community, and they invited me out to a league night, so I got to play some physical games as well! So now the addiction is in full swing!!

I learned a lot from my games, and I thought since there is very little content coming out for Star Wars CCG, that even my most-likely-very-wrong interpretations and observations might be a fun read for people, especially other NARPs. So here’s the report!

### **League Report for Friday, November 4th**

![My light side deck's objective (though it never tries to flip)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/diplomaticmissiontoalderaan.gif) 

**Game 1 – DipLo vs Court (No Scum)**  
My first game of the night was also my first game with this deck against an opponent who wasn’t myself. Suffice to say, it is a hard deck to play, and the more I played it, the more I realize that it doesn’t play how I thought it would. Whereas I assumed I’d be selling [Eopies](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Tatooine-Light/eopie.gif) left and right, I really only used [Spaceport Speeders](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/spaceportspeeders.gif) maybe twice. I also had an awful starting hand that had no vehicles, so, there’s that. So, I was off to a<img class="size-medium wp-image-10111 alignright" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/darthvaderdarklordofthesith-214x300.gif" alt="darthvaderdarklordofthesith" width="214" height="300" /> slow and uneventful start, trying to pull the [Home One](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/homeone.gif) [combo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/launchingtheassault.gif) [together](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/admiralackbar.gif) with [How Did We Get Into This Mess](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/howdidwegetintothismess.gif). My opponent got [Lone Hunter Maul](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Dark/darthmaullonehunter.gif) with his [double saber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/maulsdoublebladedlightsaber.gif) out on, I believe, the first turn, buddied him up with [Dr. E](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/drevazan.gif) and started marching from the [Audience Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/jabbaspalaceaudiencechamber.gif) to my [Cantina](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/tatooinecantina.gif) (that I really shouldn’t have deployed until I was ready to defend). I plopped a couple guys in the Cantina, but [DVDLOTS](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/darthvaderdarklordofthesith.gif) came down and choked them out. I got [Obi](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Light/obiwankenobi.gif) and his [saber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/obiwanslightsaber.gif) down to the Cantina and actually managed to knock Vader out of there, but his pal Maul was there within a turn.

As far as I can tell, this deck is sort of wimpy on the ground, so you gotta play tighter. I should have held back on deploying Cantina, and dropped a pile of guys down into the Audience Chamber once Maul was a few locations away. I honestly don’t remember what was going on in space during this game, so it must not have been much (on my end, anyway).

<img class="size-medium wp-image-10113 aligncenter" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/capitalsupport-214x300.gif" alt="capitalsupport" width="214" height="300" />  
One specific piece of knowledge about DipLo that I gained is that if you want to win, you have to be dealing damage with every possible damage dealing card you’ve got. Now, this is a noob’s perspective, but it seems you need [Tantive](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Light/tantiveiv.gif) with [Bail](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/bailorgana.gif) at [Tatooine](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Light/tatooine.gif), Launch the Assault with Home One somewhere (preferably an opponent’s system with 2 ds icons), Obi-Wan on Tatooine, somewhere other than the Cantina, draining with his saber and pinging with Ca<img class="size-medium wp-image-10112 alignleft" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/weredoomed-214x300.gif" alt="weredoomed" width="214" height="300" />pital Support, and some decent squads on your 2 other Tatooine battlegrounds. This gives you 7 damage a turn if you can’t find a good place to park the Home One. Seems pretty decent…?

Oh, and We’re Doomed. You need that card to win, I’m almost positive. You want to spread and drain, and hope they do the same, so you can effectively cancel all their pings. With [Mirax](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Light/miraxterrik.gif) you can do this every turn!

Moving on…

**Game 2 – Scum vs EBO**

I think EBO is what you call the deck I played against. Turtles up on Hoth until it does the thing that makes space an absolute nightmare for dark side, and huge drain bonuses to match. I stumbled around not knowing what to do for most of the game, punctuated by drawing way too much trying to find a [Boba Fett Bounty Hunter](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/bobafettbountyhunter.gif). Whe<img class="size-medium wp-image-10117 alignright" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/hiddenweapons-214x300.gif" alt="hiddenweapons" width="214" height="300" />n my opponent did plop down on Tatooine, it was with [Dash in Rogue 10](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Light/dashinrogue10.gif), with an extra pilot, so my hidden  
and not-so-hidden weapons were powerless against him. I managed to knock him off the site but with no impressive overflow, which is what you need with Court Scum. Oh, and, I was dodging around in space just trying to fulfill [Battle Orders](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/battleorder&firststrike.gif) and forgot to leave enough force to move my 2 ships away from the [ls death armada](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/hanchewieandthefalcon.gif) that he had assembled in front of them, so he hit me for a million and it totally lost me the game. Gotta watch those theaters, man.

Looking back, perhaps I should have dropped down on [Hoth](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Hoth-Light/hoth.gif) and started marching my way in. At very least it would have been something he had to respond to, instead of just draining my face off. I never felt like I had enough guys to throw down there though, so who knows, but I’ll definitely play it differently next time.

**Game 3 – Court vs Main on Endor**

I don’t think the deck my opponent played is a common deck type, but regardless, it was basically full of mains, ships, and toys. He started [Sai Tor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/saitorrkalfas.gif) and [Squadron Assignments](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/squadronassignments.gif), to give you an idea. This game was actually really fun and I think I could have possibly won if I had been more aggressive in space. We were basically trading drains for the bulk of it, but his were higher, even with my court damage.

I did get to make<img class="size-medium wp-image-10118 alignleft" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/jangofett-214x300.gif" alt="jangofett" width="214" height="300" /> one really fun play though. **[EDIT: Turns out the play I made doesn&#8217;t work at all because you cannot use Elis Helrot to transport captives, only your own characters. I&#8217;ve removed what I had written here because I don&#8217;t want to lead anyone astray on the rules. Suffice to say I lost this game by being drained out and I probably should have gone after Luke with a big pile of guys. Thanks to quickdraw3457 and WiseMarsellus for letting me know about this rule.**]

He  drained me out for the rest of the game. I didn’t draw a BFBH until it was far too late.

**Game 4 – DipLo vs Invasion**

<img class="size-medium wp-image-10119 aligncenter" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/invasion-214x300.gif" alt="invasion" width="214" height="300" /> 

I had never played against or honestly even read the Invasion objective, but my opponent was nice enough to give me a quick overview of what the deck does. It [draws 8s](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/battledroidblasterrifle.gif) for [battle and weapon destiny](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Endor-Dark/anentirelegionofmybesttroops.gif), and forfeits its insane amount of blasters and, cherry on top, they go [used instead of lost](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/inconsequentiallosses.gif). I know the objective does something too, but the one thing I managed was to prevent him from flipping.

So basically, I kn<img class="size-medium wp-image-10120 alignleft" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/leiarebelprincess-214x300.gif" alt="leiarebelprincess" width="214" height="300" />ew my deck could not try to fight it. The only time I went to Naboo was with Leia RP and [Lando, Scoundrel](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/landocalrissianscoundrel.gif), and my entire plan was to hopefully not lose much  
more than the 2 of them if they got caught by [battle droids](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/b2battledroid.gif), and to make him put a decent amount of said droids on Naboo, so the little bastards wouldn’t end up on Tatooine.

Main lesson learned from this game. DON’T FORGET TO ACTIVATE LUKE. EVERY. SINGLE. TURN. I probably could have won the game had I remembered to retrieve with Luke each turn, but I remembered probably 2 or 3 times the whole game, and he only won by 4 or 5 force. It was a really close match though, and taught me a valuable lesson in maximizing my deck’s damage output, retrieval capabilities, and my own cycling and tracking skills.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-10121 aligncenter" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/lukeskywalker-215x300.gif" alt="lukeskywalker" width="215" height="300" /> 

The biggest blunder of the whole game was using my successfully tracked We’re Doomed to retrieve 4 from [On the Edge](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/ontheedge.gif), without a way to pull We’re Doomed from the used pile. In those last few turns, especially in drain race mode, you have to play We’re Doomed every turn, and with Mirax it should be easy. Opponent’s who know the deck will probably opt to not grab any of your other interrupts (as tempting as they might be) and wait to grab the We’re Doomed.

All in all, I like the DipLo deck, but I didn’t<img class="size-medium wp-image-10122 alignright" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/howdidwegetintothismess-214x300.gif" alt="howdidwegetintothismess" width="214" height="300" /> find myself using the more gimmicky aspect (Spaceport Speeders and Eopies) very often. My opening hands in both games I played with the deck were lacking in at least 1 piece of the puzzle, but had enough of the other pieces that I didn’t want to Mess them. Although, to be fair, that was probably a play mistake on my part, I think as long as Mess hasn’t been grabbed, you probably want to cycling pretty much every turn. I’m considering making my own version of the deck that removes the Spaceport economy and replaces it with something more straightforward.

Lastly, look at this awesome foil v-slip I got! Thanks to msierman for the prize support for the league!

Thanks for reading! Hope it was entertaining! (Or possibly educational..?) I look forward to writing more Star Wars CCG content!
