Great news. We have an upcoming 1-day opportunity to drive additional AmazonSmile donations for Players Committee Inc.

The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) surveyed over 10,000 customers to measure perceptions of quality and value across retailers nationwide, and Amazon ranked #1.

In celebration of this recognition—and to say thank you to our customers for their support—on Thursday, March 16 only, Amazon will donate 5% (10 times our usual donation rate) of the price of eligible products customers purchase at [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=3BLXWMWSKGGS7&K=A29COO9YMKRPG7&R=20Y9SDWBPI0CE&T=C&U=http%3A%2F%2Fsmile.amazon.com%2Fch%2F80-0834739&A=MXALKXVRG0BQKEUWJ7M9OIMEFA8A&H=UKQRHGVPA7OHSKYAABRVEWZY5OMA). This offer begins at 12:00 AM Pacific Time, and expires at 11:59 PM Pacific Time.

On Thursday, March 16, share the message below on social media, your website, and in email to increase donations to Players Committee Inc. (Please do not share this promotion outside your organization until Thursday, March 16.)
