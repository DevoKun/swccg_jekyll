Greetings, Star Wars players!

Proofing has done a good job and I think we are ready to share our current spoiler list!  Now, the whole reason to be doing this is so we can get the list out to everyone well ahead of our intended release.  We want feedback!!  We want testing!!  We really liked how the community aspect of the Reset went, and we think we&#8217;d like to make that a regular thing.  To that end, the spoiler list is posted in a new subforum intended for Set 1 discussion and game results.

<http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=895&t=57472>

So let&#8217;s go over the cards one by one and chat about what, if any, has changed on them and why.

> •Colonel Wullf Yularen (V) 2  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Premiere &#8211; U1]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL  
> POWER 1 ABILITY 2  
> Text: [Pilot]1, 2: any capital starship. When deployed, may activate up to X Force (limit 4), where X = number of ISB agents on table. While aboard a starship, its power may not be reduced by opponent.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 5  
> \[Pilot\]\[Warrior\]  
> Set Icon 1

Wullf has stayed the same since being spoiled.

> •Count Dooku [Dark Maneuvers (V)] 1 ERRATA  
> [Set 0 &#8211; Premiere &#8211; C2]  
> Lore: Serennoian leader. Trade Federation.  
> CHARACTER &#8211; DARK JEDI MASTER  
> POWER 5 ABILITY 7 DARK JEDI MASTER  
> Text: Deploys -1 if Sidious on table. Power +1 for each Jedi here. During battle, may be targeted by Force Lightning. Once per game, if opponent just initiated battle here, may /\ Force Lightning or Force Push. Immune to attrition < 6 (< 8 if with a Jedi).  
> DEPLOY 6 FORFEIT 8  
> \[Warrior\]\[Pilot\]\[Separatist\]\[Episode 1\]  
> Set Icon 0

SWERVE!  Easily the biggest change on this set has been the idea to errata Dooku to work only during battle.  I have been against this for a while, but over time a lot of people whose opinions I respect felt this was a good move and over time their arguments won me over.  At this time, we really want to hear from you about this.  There have been some passionate pro-Dooku arguments in testing (feel free to repost these, guys!) and I&#8217;d very much like to hear from those who think he is fine as is.  As you will see later, with this change I don&#8217;t think we need to do anything further regarding Force Lightning.

> •Corporal Vandolay (V) 2  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Dagobah &#8211; U]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL  
> POWER 2 ABILITY 2  
> Text: [Pilot]1. When deployed, may take an ISB agent here into hand. Once per turn, if you just drew an ISB agent for battle destiny, may take that card into hand to cancel and re-draw that destiny.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 4  
> \[Warrior\] \[Pilot\]  
> Set Icon 1

The good Corporal remains unchanged.

> •Djas Puhr (V) 1  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Premiere &#8211; R2]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 2 ABILITY 4 FORCE-SENSITIVE  
> Text: Your total ability may not be reduced at same site. Your Force drains here may not be canceled by [Reflections III] Leia. Djas Puhr is power, defense value and forfeit +1 for each [Dark Side] icon here.  
> DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 4  
> [Warrior]  
> Set Icon 1

Djas got a power boost (from a base of 1 to a base of 2), but otherwise is pretty much as-spoiled.

> •Jango Fett (TBD) 1  
> [Set 1 &#8211; ? &#8211; ?]  
> Lore: Trade Federation bounty hunter.  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 4 ABILITY 3 ARMOR 5  
> Text: [Pilot]2. Adds 1 to maneuver of anything he pilots. Adds one battle destiny with opponent&#8217;s Jedi, [Maintenance], or [Permanent Weapon] card. May be targeted by Hidden Weapons. If about to be lost, may /\ Boba Fett.  
> DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 6  
> \[Pilot\]\[Warrior\][Episode I]  
> Set Icon 1

This is where all the various versions of cards get confusing to me.  I think he is as spoiled, but if he doesn&#8217;t match, it&#8217;s because he allows you to upload any version of Boba Fett.

> •Lt. Pol Treidum (V) 3  
> [Set 1 &#8211; A New Hope &#8211; C1]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL  
> POWER 2 ABILITY 1  
> Text: [Pilot]1. When deployed (or leaves table), may draw top card of Reserve Deck or Used Pile. During battle, attrition against you is -1 for each ISB agent here (limit -3). Your non-Undercover spies here are immune to Double Agent.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 5  
> \[Warrior\]\[Pilot\]  
> Set Icon 1

Here&#8217;s our third ISB agent in the set.

> •Wooof (V) 3  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Jabba&#8217;s Palace &#8211; R]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 2 ABILITY 2  
> Text: [Pilot]3. Wooof may deploy with any cruiser using Combat Response. While aboard an [Independent] starship, subtract 1 from opponent&#8217;s battle and weapon destinies here.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 4  
> [Pilot]  
> Set Icon 1

Unchanged.

> Turn it Off! Turn It Off! (V) 5  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Hoth &#8211; C1]  
> USED INTERRUPT  
> Text: Play a Defensive Shield from under your Starting Effect. OR If opponent just deployed a [Maintenance] card, it may not battle for remainder of turn. OR Cancel Out Of Commission (if attempting to place a card out of play). [Immune to Sense]  
> Set Icon 1

This was what used to be ComScan Detection.  We wanted to remove some of the versatility, so the Clash cancel goes.  We were concerned about its strength compared to the LS version, so we decided to try it as a destiny 5, all USED Interrupt.  We also made the entire card immune to Sense &#8211; basically we wanted to make the barrier text better, and figured it wouldn&#8217;t be too much to just extend the immunity to all 3 options.

Opponent&#8217;s characters require +1 Force to move from Tatooine sites using their landspeed. Once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one trooper.  
> Flip this card if opponent controls more Tatooine sites than you.  
> Set Icon 1

Unchanged.

> Slave I, Symbol Of Fear [Slave I (V)] 3  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Cloud City &#8211; R]  
> STARFIGHTER: FIRESPRAY-CLASS ATTACK SHIP  
> POWER 3 MANEUVER 5 HYPERSPEED 5  
> Text: May add 2 pilots and 2 passengers. Power +1 for each opponent’s starship here. While Jango or Boba Fett piloting, immune to attrition < 5.  
> DEPLOY 3 FORFEIT 5  
> \[Scomp Link\]\[Nav Computer\]\[Independent\]\[Episode I\]  
> Set Icon 1

We felt it was better to do a full &#8220;C&#8221; slip here for the destiny boost text, and proofing suggested going back to the old name from Legacy since we had the C slip already.  The functional change was to allow any Boba to be a Matching pilot to it.  We weren&#8217;t too concerned with BFBH since it costs a lot to get the most out of him.

> •Lando Calrissian (V) 1

> Text: Whenever opponent deploys a character to same or adjacent site, may activate 1 Force. While with Amidala, forfeit +1, and once per turn may peek at the top card of your Force Pile and Reserve Deck; return one card to each deck or pile.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 3  
> Set Icon 1

This is a new Republic character who could go in WHAP, but isn&#8217;t good enough yet.  We were toying with the idea of making Handmaidens better so you could potentially use My Loyal Bodyguard, but just wanted to dip our toe in the water.

> •A New Secret Base (V) 5

> EFFECT  
> Text: Deploy on table. Once per turn, may use 2 Force to \/ a battleground system. Your non-unique starfighters apply their deployment modifiers at any location. Once per turn, if you just Force drained at a battleground system, may draw top card of Reserve Deck. [Immune to Alter]

> Text: During your deploy phase, use X Force (minimum 1) to relocate X of your characters at an interior Theed Palace site to Theed Palace Throne Room. [Immune to Sense] OR If opponent occupies your location, peek at top two cards of your Reserve Deck and take one into hand.  
> Set Icon 1

I think we had some minor changes, about putting a minimum cost on this so it couldn&#8217;t be cycled for free.  I&#8217;m pretty sure the spoiled version had the deploy phase restriction on it.

> Perimeter Scan (V) 4  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Hoth &#8211; C2]  
> USED OR LOST INTERRUPT  
> Text: USED: Play a Defensive Shield from under your Starting Effect. OR Target opponent&#8217;s just deployed [Maintenance] card. Target may not battle (or allow opponent to \/ cards) this turn. [Immune to Sense] LOST: Cancel Trample (unless targeting an undercover spy).  
> Set Icon 1

Scan is still scan.  We gave the barrier Immunity to sense, but because it&#8217;s a little stronger card than the DS version it remains a 4 and USED/LOST.  Lost is now just a Trample cancel.  We were debating about doing some sort of scrub protection only, but it felt very situational to do it versus just one interrupt.  If against Force Lightning and Trample, that would be of interest to me, but with the Dooku change it seemed clunky.

> •Anoat (V) (Light Side)  
> [Set 1 &#8211; Dagobah &#8211; U]  
> LOCATION &#8211; SYSTEM  
> LIGHT (2): Force loss from Security Precautions is reduced by 4.  
> \[Planet\]\[Parsec 5\]  
> Set Icon 1

Good feedback on this guy.  Based on that, we removed the DS text entirely about making it a drain -1 system and instead upped the SecPre hate by 1.

> Text: Permanent pilot is •Green Leader, who provides ability of 2. Adds one battle destiny with a Rebel snub fighter. During battle, may cancel immunity to attrition of any starship here; this A-wing is &#8216;hit.&#8217;  
> DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 4  
> \[Permanent Pilot\]\[Nav Computer\][Scomp Link]  
> Set Icon 1

Due to some text space concerns, and the idea of making some design space to explore in the future, we are going to add to rules what a &#8220;snub fighter&#8221; is.  It&#8217;s going to be defined the exact way it is on Balanced Attack.
