Hi everyone,

I didn&#8217;t want to formally write again until I had some clear news about Set 2, but the time to talk is now.  Since my last post, we&#8217;ve had some cards change text, and I&#8217;ve updated them on their own threads and on the master list, without much fanfare.  Today, we had what I believe will be the last two changes for Set 2.

all changes can be seen here on the Master List thread:

First, Like My Father Before Me has updated text.  We removed the Interrupt pull and went back to a conditional activation text.  Second, the player creator has chosen to pull Grievous from the set to work on him some more.  This is never an easy decision, but I think the card overall will be much stronger when it does see release.

Of greatest interest, the question of when Set 2 will release has an answer &#8211; July 17.  It is our plan to have the PDF ready for immediate use in games in a little over 2 weeks &#8211; and maybe sooner.

I&#8217;m now going to shift focus and look more into Set 3.  There has been a lot of good discussion about the public PT experiment, and I do think it deserves a set where I am firmly at the helm.  We&#8217;ll see how this works, but I want to publicly thank those who did test and who did report, especially Lenny Rubin (lsrubin) and Tom Haid (Xanth) &#8211; their effort really stood out to me and I greatly appreciate their efforts!
