Hey SWCCG fans,

The PC is excited to announce that Virtual Card Set 2 is finished and ready for tournament use, effective July 17.

We&#8217;d like to thank the various groups that helped get this set ready for release: the player creators, the player card developers, the main dev team, proofing, and the general player base for their helpful playtesting and card balance discussion ideas. We know this set was a bit of an experiment, with opening everything up for public playtesting, and are grateful for the help of the community to try to work together productively to balance everything to the best of our ability. Thanks also to those player creators who had cards tested in this set that got pushed back, your patience is appreciated as we strive to re-balance those designs into a future set. 

MTFBWY,
