Greetings SWCCG Players!

I&#8217;ll get right to the chase &#8212; as promised, see below for the full Set 6 spoiler text. The set is 14 cards that are largely centered around Rogue One, with player cards involved as well.

_Disclaimer: The exact wording and underlying card may differ from the final release. Any card that is full template (with a new name) will not change from a C/UC to a R, although some full templates below are on rare cards (such as The Falcon and What Chance Do We Have)._

_Edit: An earlier version of this spoiler list had Bodhi Rook at deploy 3. He is Deploy 2._

First, I&#8217;ll address the obvious questions about what is missing: Chirrut, Baze, and Krennic. We tested these extensively, and couldn&#8217;t find the right balance on them. We found a version of Baze that we really liked, but it entered testing late because the first version wasn&#8217;t good enough, and I wasn&#8217;t comfortable releasing it with only a small amount of testing. Chirrut is a card that we found to be very divisive &#8212; some people loved the version we tested most, others found it lacking in flavor. Everybody was most excited to see what an interesting character he could be, and this actually led to everyone having their own idea of what he should be. I fear it may be hard to find a version of him that everyone likes, but you can be sure that when he is released, he will be oozing with flavor. We&#8217;re very excited about him, and want to make sure we get it right before releasing him. Finally, Krennic: we tested a version of him that added a destiny to power or attrition &#8212; but only under certain thematic conditions, such as not being with Tarkin or an Imperial of ability > 3 (because when surrounded by others with more power than him, he crumbles). Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t find the right balance with him either. I expect all 3 of these to be released in the next coming set after we go back to the drawing board a little bit.

Next: regarding the delay in this set, I can give some more background on how this happened, and what we&#8217;re doing to improve. I shared my thoughts internally early on that I wanted April 7th to be the release date, since it was 4 weeks before the Endor Grand Prix. I was confident that our agile process could propel us to meet this date. Unfortunately, the agile process isn&#8217;t quite as far along as I thought it was, in large part due to my inexperience with it, and not setting up proper communication channels within the group when a card goes from one stage to the next. I have a plan in place for next set where this will flow much more smoothly.

Additionally, since I came on late last summer as Design Advocate, much of that time had been spent with D&D building up a backlog of cards that we want to send to playtesting. For the first time, I feel like we&#8217;re a little bit ahead of the curve (but not quite as much as I&#8217;d like). What this means is that instead of a gap between release of Set X and testing of Set X + 1, we will be getting right back into testing the next set almost immediately after the release of this one (sorry playtesters, no rest for the wicked!). As we go on, that backlog is going to be bigger and bigger. The idea is that we can keep approving cards as we go so we have a &#8220;ready for release&#8221; set of cards that give us the agility to say &#8220;we&#8217;ve got a good group of cards here, let&#8217;s put a bow on it and release it&#8221; (hence the term &#8220;agile&#8221;). This also lets us react to issues quicker. For instance, if we see a card or interaction as problematic, we can put that card through the process quicker and insert it right into the next ready for release set as soon as we&#8217;re comfortable with it, and thus allowing us to respond to a competitive balance problem in a shorter time than we could if it had to go through development and playtesting with an entire set.

I hope this sheds some light on what is happening behind the scenes, and I hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are to play with these new cards.
