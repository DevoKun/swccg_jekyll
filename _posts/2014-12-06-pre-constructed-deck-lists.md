Decipher, Inc. released a pre-constructed deck for each side of the Force for Episodes IV, V, and VI.

The first two deck sets were from the Parker Bros. Introductory game boxes that each came with two fixed, 60-card decks, a large rule book, and a booster pack. The cards in the fixed decks were all white border and the decks themselves featured exclusive cards that not found anywhere else, including very, very under-powered versions of the main characters, such as [Vader](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/PremiereIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/vader.gif) and [Luke](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/PremiereIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Light/large/luke.gif "Luke") (from the Premiere set) and [Chewie](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Light/large/chewie.gif) and [Veers](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/veers.gif) (from the Empire Strikes Back set); however there were still some powerful cards players would seek from the sets, including [Vader&#8217;s Obsession](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/PremiereIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/vadersobsession.gif) and [Run Luke, Run!](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/PremiereIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Light/large/runlukerun.gif), as well as [Walker Garrison](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/walkergarrison.gif) and [Imperial Walker](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/EmpireStrikesBackIntroductoryTwoPlayerGame-Dark/large/imperialwalker.gif).

The last set of fixed decks were the Death Star II Pre-constructed decks, which all contained the same 60 black bordered cards in each box for each side of the Force, as well as a rule booklet. The decks themselves were fairly playable out of the box, especially in the &#8220;Battle of Endor&#8221; closed environment or as a solid back-drop for a Sealed Deck event. The decks featured cards primarily from the Endor and Death Star II expansions, however also included some staple cards from earlier expansions. The decks also each had a total of three rare cards in them: Tempest 1, Tempest Scout 3 and the starter deck-exclusive [Admiral Piett](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Dark/large/admiralpiett.gif) for the Dark Side; General Solo, Chewbacca of Kashyyyk and the starter deck exclusive [Admiral Ackbar](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/DeathStarII-Light/large/admiralackbar.gif) for the Light Side.

Newer players can download these decks directly from [Holotable](http://holotable.com/), which is a way to play Star Wars CCG for free over the internet, by clicking [here](http://holotable.com/download/downloads/fixeddecks.zip)  _(note: as of this writing, the Premiere Light Side deck contained one error; having an additional CZ-3 instead of a third Timer Mine)_.
