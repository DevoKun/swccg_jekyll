Heya! Trevor here, and I figured that I&#8217;d share my experience as a relatively newer player who lost in the first round, but then made it to the final game of the consolation. First a bit about me! I started playing with the Pittsburgh crew approximately 2.5 years ago. Since then I&#8217;ve been to every MPC and worlds since then and have thoroughly enjoyed each event. Even after 3 MPCs, I still haven&#8217;t won a first round, though this was the closest I&#8217;ve come. When I was trying to pick decks for this event, I knew I would need to play something that I was comfortable with. For Light I had given the Old Allies speeders (12 card start) deck several tries and it clicked pretty well for me. Given a probable resurgence in Dark side mains, I figured that this would be a pretty solid deck as long as it played it safe from P-59/dengar (and hope and pray that I don&#8217;t run into crash landing). For Dark I pretty much had it narrowed down to IE and court scum, but since I&#8217;ve played IE every other MPC and I generally find scum decks more fun to play, I decided to go with Court (starting Battle Order combo, Wipe them Out, and Jabba&#8217;s Haven). So let&#8217;s jump into the games!

Match 1 Game 1 (Main Event Round 1): Steve Cellucci&#8217;s IE with Troopers (Mob points, endor shield, IAO)  
I decided early on that trying to anticipate what Steve would play would be pretty hard. He tends to come up with some off the wall stuff and in that regard, he did exactly what I expected. This looked like a standard build at first, deploying piett and ozzel and moving over to Jakku. I had a pretty fantastic start, finding BNC, Harc, Poe, and Rey. So I deployed them all and flew up with Finn and a spin combo in hand. When he started deploying unique troopers that I&#8217;ve never seen before all over Tatooine, flipped and played occupation turn 2, then I knew I was in trouble. I decided that I was going to need to flip myself before trying to go after the devastator so Occupation didn&#8217;t whittle me down. So I drained, then replaced his AO, got one of my speeders on the ground with wedge and finn to both sites, then consolidated on the 2/2 (I realized that Wedge doesn&#8217;t work with Finn since Finn isn&#8217;t a pilot, but I didn&#8217;t have any other pilots in hand). I think I also projectioned one or two of his sites. His third turn, he caused about 4-5 damage, then deployed a bunch of troopers to Jakku, played trooper assault, and I had to forfeit both of my pilots to the battle damage, flipping me back. On my turn, I come back down with more pilots and manage to kill everything but the Garrison, but I wasn&#8217;t able to flip back. So on his next turn, he did about 8-10 damage and recycled the garrison. Now I&#8217;m playing from behind, so I decide to go after one of his lone characters at Jundland Wastes. I deployed Anakin and he got barriered, but I decided he should be fine with the 6 that I had tracked to the top of my deck. That&#8217;s when I found out that I should really remember to read cards that I don&#8217;t play often&#8230; like the Jundland Wastes LS text. Oops! He overflowed me for a decent amount and the game ends with him at 17 life force. Not looking very optimistic&#8230;  
Highlight of the game: Unfortunately, my Anakin misplay  
Game Result: Loss -17 diff

Match 1 Game 2 (Main Event Round 1): Steve Cellucci&#8217;s Diplo with Jabba&#8217;s Palace stuff (Guts, Strike Planning, and Wokling)  
So as soon as I saw his starting effects, I knew I was in trouble. I mean&#8230; who the heck starts with Guts??? I get out Jabba and draw up. He deploys Harc, General Solo, Bail, and Mon Mothma, and shuttles up. So now I know my scum retrieve is done for the game, le sigh. I get out Elis and Wooof to Nal Hutta figuring that as soon as he runs away from Tatooine, I can go there to start draining for 3. On his turn, he deploys Chandrila (I think it was in his force pile turn 1) and moves over. As planned, I deployed Zuckuss to Tatooine and move Elis to join him. Cellucci took the bait and moved the Tantive IV pile back to Tatooine with some more forfeit fodder. So far everything is looking pretty good. The only damage I&#8217;ve taken is a drain of 2 at Chandrila (silly Bail), while he&#8217;s taken a couple rounds of ping damage, as well as both of my drains. So on my turn, I unload Guri and non-V stinger, 4-lom, EPP IG-88 and a few other guys for forfeit fodder (what I would&#8217;ve done for a BFBH in that battle&#8230;). So he went from 3 destinies to 1 and I went from 1 to 4. He ends up losing R2&C3PO and Mon Mothma and I toss a small scrub. It looks like he doesn&#8217;t have an answer for Guri, so he plays Booster in Pulsar Skate and moves C3PO from the dune sea all the way to Alderaan to deliver the plans. The Tantive IV runs away to Chandrila. The rest of space game was Guri and Zuckuss following the Tantive, while Elis took on Booster. There weren&#8217;t any more battles in space, so attention was shifted to the ground. There were a few battles at the Dune Sea and Audience chamber since I had thinned my forces out (couldn&#8217;t draw much since I was getting pretty close to the 17 life force cutoff. There was a moment where I tried to Elis on his turn with 1 Force active thinking I had tracked a 1 on top. He immediately revealed quite a mercenary and I was like &#8220;wait, I gotta pay for it&#8221;. At that point, I could&#8217;ve just declined to pay the cost and sent Elis to lost pile, but that would&#8217;ve seemed cheap. Instead, I luckily discovered that sometimes I suck at tracking and there was a 4 on top! Crisis averted<img class="smilies" title="Smile" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /> . Finally I get down to 16 life force and no hand and Cellucci asks a judge about what would happen for the tiebreaker in case it happens. Since he had the advantage in lost piles, he would win, so he started drawing up. I retrieved my 4th ship with SSPFTv and force the tie, but lose the tiebreaker. Definitely one of the most exciting games I&#8217;ve had and a ton of fun playing against weird decks like Cellucci&#8217;s.  
Highlight of the game: Guri being a boss and shutting down Cellucci&#8217;s space game  
Match Result: Loss by tiebreaker

Match 2 Game 1 (Consolation Round 1): Jan Westergard&#8217;s TTO  
Oh boy&#8230; Jan playing TTO, that&#8217;s always dangerous. Combat response, so I know it&#8217;s probably TIEs and guns. He gets Jerjerrod in a Saber to Endor. And then I miss my Rey&#8217;s Encampment pull&#8230; Oh boy&#8230; Thankfully I had Ackbar in hand and Home One in the Force Pile, so I drew for it and then passed. He played Saber 1 with Fel to Jakku and then tried to move Jerjerrod to join him, but I pointed out it was too far (4 parsecs!). My second turn, I put Wedge, Poe, Theron Nett and Rey in the Falcon and take off. I think he battles, he tries to shoot me to make me lose a force, but misses. He spins for a 7 so that I can&#8217;t cancel his destiny, so I end up losing Rey and he loses Baron. I spend the next turn flipping consolidate on the 2/2 so that I can start reducing that silly drain of 2 at Endor. He then comes down with a couple of ships to Jakku to battle and plays All Power to Weapons. I think I end up having to forfeit one character. On my turn, I play Home One, Ackbar, and Goldenrod and battle. He reacts with Saber 4 and Darth Maul for 2 Force, ending the battle. He finally finishes TTO on his turn and moves everyone to Kashyyyk along with the superlaser. I&#8217;ve started my damage, so I did some pilot swapping and left the Falcon at Jakku, while Ackbar and Theron Nett left to take on the Death Star II. My ability was still blanked, but I had Hera, some forfeit fodder, Obi in Radiant VII, and two Rebel Leaderships in hand. He got a turn of damage on me deployed a few more guys to Kashyyyk. So I dropped everything on him (he grabbed leadership) and he had to lose almost half his forces (the Combined Fleet Action really hurt him this game). He tries to counterbeat with Boba Fett and Tarkin, but when I play my second leadership, he scoops.  
Highlight of the game: Home One taking on the Death Star II like a boss  
Match Result: Win (Jan forfeited the second game)

Match 3 Game 1 (Consolation Round 2): Bill Kafer&#8217;s Invasion (You&#8217;ll be dead, Entire Legion, Inconsequential Losses)  
After getting some Chipotle and wandering around for almost 1.5 hours, I was ready to get back into a game. Bill picked Dark Side and showed Invasion and since I&#8217;m good friends with Matt Carulli, I&#8217;ve had a lot of practice against it. I showed Old Allies and Bill tells me that one of the reasons he picked Invasion was because it beats Old Allies speeders. Challenge accepted<img class="smilies" title="Twisted Evil" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" /> . He opens up with Tey How to the ship and draws. I get Harc Seff, Solo, and Rey to Jakku. He plays a B2 Droid with blaster to the Generator and leaves 1 force active. On my turn, I should have just taken the turn to set up and flip, but instead decide to go after the droid with Anakin and Lando. I play Antilles Maneuver so that he can&#8217;t fire and he draws an 8 for BD (so 9 attrition) and everything at the site clears (at least I forced a ghhhk?). The rest of the game I was hurting for pilots, so I really should&#8217;ve just taken the time to set up and taken the drain of 2 and ping of 1. After that misplay, I move the Falcon to Naboo to force his ship out of hiding (holding Home One, Ackbar and a spin). He redeploys the droid/gun to the generator, some forfeit fodder to the ship and moves to Jakku. This is the crucial turn. I need to kill the ship this or next turn or else I&#8217;m not going to be outdamaging them. Thankfully, he didn&#8217;t play justice, so I played Home One and Ackbar and battled. I was a little bit worried about Laser Cannon Batteries, but I found out later that it hadn&#8217;t made his cut. I make him lose most of his forfeit fodder and Tey How. I leave the Falcon at Naboo for force him into battling one of my ships. On his turn, he deploys a droid and gun to the ship, and decides the Falcon is the lesser threat. I spend the turn deploying two of my speeders and pilots to the ground to flip, Corran Horn to the Falcon and battle in space. I end up drawing high and then spinning for 10, making him lose everything. I leave the falcon at Naboo so I&#8217;m draining for 2 and 2 in space, and I consolidate my forces at the 2/2. He comes down hard for my 2/2 site with some droids and then P-59 (uh-oh). I believe he hits Wedge&#8217;s speeder, so now I&#8217;m not canceling destinies on the ground anymore. I figure my only shot is to get the Falcon on the ground to sit in front of P-59. So I deploy Booster and Mirax to naboo to continue the drain, I believe my second Wedge to my remaining speeder, move the Falcon to Jakku and move my speeder to the 2/1. On his turn, he deploys a droid/gun to the swamp to start the damage race and moves his Jakku forces in front of my speeder. I end up dropping the Falcon (defense value 7, so it&#8217;s safe from P-59 with the -2 from the objective) in front of P-59 and move the speeder away. Somewhere around here, I&#8217;ve got my baragwin in space and he&#8217;s retrieving some rebel flight suits to save some damage. So I&#8217;m doing about 5-6 damage a turn and he&#8217;s doing 5, but he&#8217;s paying for 2 drains. My last turn, I ended up dropping Booster and mirax to the swamp to block the drain 2, so he gets me down to two and the game ends when I drain him out on my turn.  
Highlight of the game: Mirax and Booster&#8217;s final sacrifice  
Game Result: Win +2

Match 3 Game 2 (Consolation Round 2): Bill Kafer&#8217;s Throne Room (Sai&#8217;tor, Like My Father, Wokling)  
This matchup can either be really good, or really bad. Basically, whoever get&#8217;s the audience chamber is going to have the upper hand all game. His turn one he draws. I play Jabba and move him to the Dungeon. He draws some and saves some. I have a barrier in hand, so I feel comfortable leaving Jabba at the dungeon another turn, so I lose to Court and draw into 4-lom and leave a couple active. He comes down with Corran and then Mace and saber (who I barrier). He battles with Corran and both characters die, leaving Mace at the Dungeon. I use Jabba&#8217;s Haven to get Jabba back, play him, Scum, 4-lom, and I think Velken. He deployed someone and moved Mace over, despite repeatedly saying how much he hates 4-LOM. I disarm Mace on my turn, played a bunch of guys and cleared him off the site. On his turn, he deploys Luke and saber to the pit and draws up. I have an Elis, and since I start First strike, I decided to go for the beatdown. He didn&#8217;t have the Elis canceller, so I overflowed Luke and he scooped.  
Highlight of the game: 4-LOM calmly showing Mace who&#8217;s boss  
Match Result: Win

Side note: Kafer was a ton of fun to play against. Always joking, having fun and laughing. Kudos to you man!

Match 4 Game 1 (Consolation Round 3): Casey Anis&#8217; Hunt Down (Conduct Your Search, I Am Your Father, and something else)  
This was the reason that I decided to play this deck&#8230; finally DS mains! Also, being a 15 seed, I never got to chose which side to play first, but everyone on Day 1 was picking to start with Dark! He goes Vader and saber to Niima, while I play harc seff (4/4 on drawing harc in opening hand on Day 1), solo and rey and take off for the system. He drains for 3 and after losing one or two from my hand, I have to lose off the top&#8230; and there goes my 2/2 site. Guess I&#8217;m not flipping! Suddenly I&#8217;m a lot less confident. He reinforces with I think Emperor. I drop Home one and ackbar to the system and move the ship back down (finn in hand). He drops tarkin and dengar. That&#8217;s right, turn 3 dengar&#8230; oh boy. I&#8217;m sweating bullets as he initiates battle, but thankfully his 3 blind draws (tarkin canceled and redrew one) were all less than 5, so the Falcon lived to see another day. I draw high for my destinies and he&#8217;s limited to one because of CFA, so I either didn&#8217;t lose anyone or I lost Finn. I decided I couldn&#8217;t take anymore chances with Dengar, so I decide to take off and dig for my Anakin/Corran/Chewie and a Wesa/Antilles Maneuver (for the 7 draws). I also deployed Leia in space to cancel the drain and dug for the missing ground pieces. On his turn, I cancel the drain and he goes to the Back door with Blizz 4 (pulling mara for 2) and maul in ship to cloak at the system. I play projection to the back door and Obiwan in Rad VII to the system. On his turn, he drains and I play It Could Be Worse, which he grabs (leaving me free to loop Wesa). And then it looks like he forgets to move Maul and I&#8217;m silently cheering inside. I deploy Anakin to Home one and a speeder, Hera, and some scrub to the Back Door. The battle at the back door clears everything except my empty speeder. Then I initiate battle in space. Or at least try to&#8230; Yeah stupid Skywalkers&#8230; So I load up the falcon with both skywalkers, Solo, and Rey and land the Falcon (Wesa in hand, Mirax on Home One ready to track it around and get it again). He drops the Emperor to the back door (with overseeing it personally), a guy or two to Niima and battles. First dengar shot is a miss, second is a tracked 7, which I Wesa. I draw 2 high destinies, he&#8217;s limited to one and I think he draws high. I forfeit Leia, he forfeits a couple guys. He lands maul and passes. I drain in space, reload the falcon (can&#8217;t battle because of Anakin), then drop wedge and Theron Nett to the back door. I overflow the Emperor and now control space and the back door pretty securely. He tells me he&#8217;s drawing up and I manage to unload my hand of 7 (the whole thing!).  
Highlight of the game: Dengar desperately needs some target practice  
Game Result: Win by about 14

Match 4 Game 2 (Consolation Round 3): Casey Anis&#8217; Combat (Sai&#8217;tor, Wokling, Like My Father)  
This was pretty similar to the throne room matchup I had with Kafer, except I got to go first and he gave me 4 icons. So yeah&#8230; I was pretty confident in the matchup. Jabba to Audience chamber and draw (leaving two with a barrier and stunning leader in hand). Luke and saber to audience chamber (barriered) and he draws. I deploy a bunch of guys and battled, clearing luke while I only lost a scrub or two (I think I had velken out, so he had to swing at him). He went Yoda to the 2/2 and draws. I play Elis, Wooof, and zuckuss to space and reload my hand. He drains for 2, then plays Luke and saber at the 3/2 and passes. I drop 3 or 4 characters on Luke, cease fired him, and drew 2-3 destinies. I believe he scooped at this point. Probably missed a turn or two in this last game, but I was getting pretty worn out.  
Highlight of the game: Finishing&#8230; so goddamn tired  
Match Result: Win

So I&#8217;ve gone 7-1 today and feeling really good about my play (minus the screw up with Anakin that cost me the Cellucci match). I find out that the top 4 for the consolation is me, Barry, Schmaltz, and Jarad. All people I&#8217;ve played before! Schmaltz knocked me out of the MPC 2 years ago and Jarad knocked me out at last year&#8217;s MPC. I&#8217;m going to be paired against Jarad, so I get a chance at revenge<img class="smilies" title="Twisted Evil" src="http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" /> . So I end up going to dinner at the restaurant downstairs with a crew that includes Barry, Tom Haid, Schmaltz, and Lenny. We end up talking about what we saw today and I hear something about Chief Bast and ask them about it and they launch into how he can do the whole evacuation thing on the ground. I thought it sounded broken, but kudos for Tom to figuring out weird * like that. I personally loved his Dainsom find and was really disappointed when he got errataed. But that&#8217;s besides the point. Everyone else from Pittsburgh had been eliminated from the main event and consolation, so I was the only one who needed to organize some decks for the next day. The Carulli bros helped me a bunch by talking it through and I ended up settling on sticking with Court (took out the Hidden Weapons stuff and one of the Cease Fires to add another barrier, imbalance combo, and disarmed. I decided to switch out my Old Allies deck tho because I thought it was too easy to tech for. So I borrowed Justin&#8217;s Day 1 TRM deck and familiarized myself with it and the strategy. Then got a few hours of sleep. As I was writing the decklists in the morning, I decided that I needed an answer for Chief Bast since I knew there was a good chance of Barry or Schmaltz playing it. The TRM played Phylo so that it could take over the docking bays for IE and TTO, so I knew that getting those drains was imperative. So I decided to toss in a Demotion. Decklists are done, let&#8217;s get on to the last 4 games.

Consolation Semifinals Game 1: Jarad Konsker&#8217;s TRM (Insurrection combo, K&#8217;lor&#8217;slug, and wokling)  
I got to play dark first! Matt had beat Jarad in the first round of the main event and this looked to be pretty similar to what Matt described, so I was pretty confident. Unfortunately, a lot of the turn by turn plays elude me minus a few highlights, but I&#8217;ll do my best. He drew first turn so I deployed Jabba and moved over. I think he drew again, so I played scum, deployed velken, and I think Snoova, then moved Jabba over. He came down someone (Lando?) who I barriered, then he deployed Leia with 4 Force left. He wisely did not cancel Scum because leaving no force against Court is never a good idea. I came down with a bunch of guys including I think Djas Puhr and battled him off the site. On his turn, I think he went Obi to the Pit. I needed to reload on characters, so I just deployed Elis/Wooof/Zuckuss to Nal Hutta. Jarad then surprised me with a Booster in Pulsar Skate, Anakin, Corran Horn, and Lando to Space and I lost Zuckuss and Wooof (he lost Anakin). So I see that it&#8217;s just Booster and Corran piloting in space. Perfect! I use Jabba&#8217;s Haven to get back Zuckuss and deploy it and a pilot and battle. I draw lowish and he draws two high. Then I find out that Booster is ability 3&#8230; DAMMIT&#8230; So I end up losing everyone but Zuckuss and he just loses Lando I think. On the counterbeat, he plays Redemption v to get back Luke With Lightsaber and I end up using a Ghhhk. So I&#8217;ve lost space for the game, but I&#8217;m dominating on the ground, so I decide to just pitch the rest of my space. I finally get a big beatdown at the pit (and then drain for 2 with Velken there!) and end up winning with a +28 differential.  
Highlight of the game: Learning that I played with Booster for almost 5 hours yesterday without reading his card  
Game Result: Win +28

Consolation Semifinals Game 2: Jarad Konsker&#8217;s Hunt Down (I Am Your Father, Conduct Your search, and something)  
We started this knowing that Jarad had almost no chance since Hunt Down tends to not win by 28 or more, but we played it through anyways. The play by play is basically this: I drew. He played back door and Emperor. I played Luke (with saber), battled, hit the Emperor and did some overflow. He played Blizzard 4 with Vader (no saber). I played Lando and battled, missed Vader, lost lando, he lost vader and blizzard 4. He played vader (with saber), battled, we hit each other, and he had a couple to overflow. I played Luke (with saber). He played Vader (with saber), battled, missed luke, and I hit vader. He scooped.  
Highlight of the game: None, it was boring  
Match Result: Win

Consolation Finals Game 1: Matt Schmaltz&#8217;s Old Allies (12 card start)  
So he&#8217;s playing my Day 1 deck&#8230; oh boy. Since Desai and Chu decided to skip the final, this one actually got streamed, so if you want to see this grueling slugfest, be my guest! The match ended up being the only game that went to time for me this weekend, but that was because of scum retrieval and lots of destiny canceling and limiting. I&#8217;ve included the link to the stream as well as relevant timestamps below if you want to skip around to some of the action. Overall, I think I played this match pretty damned well except for two situations: First, after he played home one and battled me, I deployed zuckuss, 4-lom, and a couple other guys to the ship and battled him. I should&#8217;ve just passed and held out in space as long as possible to prevent him from flipping. Second, I used Jabba&#8217;s Haven to get back Ponda Baba v to add a destiny to attrition on the ground, not realizing that if Wedge cancels my destiny, then I don&#8217;t get any attrition to add a destiny to. Early on, I got screwed by some really poor destinies (I drew the bridge twice and Djas Puhr at least 3 times), but I finally got around to tracking my 5s around and knocked out wedge&#8217;s speeder towards the end to drag the differential down.  
Highlight of the game: Zam Wesell getting out the last couple force loss by killing Hera on my last turn of the game  
Game Result: Timed Loss -0 (-5 diff in loss piles)

Consolation Finals Game 2: Matt Schmaltz&#8217;s TTO (Kuat drive yards)  
So I get a pretty good hand, and when I&#8217;m looking for my docking bay, I notice that Demotion is in the Force Pile. So I dig for it (finding Threepio in the process) and pass. He searches his deck and I get to verify&#8230; and I see Chief Bast! Glad that last minute tech is gonna pay off :-). So I&#8217;m sorta almost shaking with excitement but I manage to keep myself contained and try to put on a sort of despairing look. He doesn&#8217;t deploy Jerjerrod to space or the bunker (I had open handed Corran, so it was good he didn&#8217;t go there). Turn 2 I deployed Luke and Threepio. His second turn he drew up again (letting me verify his deck again). My third turn, I drained and drew a couple, then saved about 5. His third turn he deployed Maul&#8217;s Sith Infiltrator, Bast, and Jerferrod to the docking bay. I&#8217;m barely holding it together. My turn, I play Lando, Demotion, battle and he overflows TTO, ending the match. I heard that Booker went sorta crazy on the stream when it happened, so I got a kick out of that when I rewatched it.  
Highlight of the game: As Brian Fred put it, &#8220;This was probably the first time in Star Wars CCG history that someone played demotion on Chief Bast.&#8221;  
Match Result: Win

Overall an incredible experience. I really enjoyed playing against all of my opponents had an incredible weekend playing some Star Wars cards. I even got interviewed (5:09 in the stream), so that was neat! And now I&#8217;m literally falling asleep, so I&#8217;m gonna call it a night. Toodles!
