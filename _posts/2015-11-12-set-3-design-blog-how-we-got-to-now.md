Greetings Star Wars players!

It has been a while since an official communication has been sent to you all for Set 3, so I&#8217;d like to first set the stage for what has been going on in D&D recently.

Set 3 was viewed by D&D as the first real open slate for a brand new set in the post-reset SWCCG world. Set 1 included minor tweaks released with Set 0, as well as some quick fixes that the game needed after evaluating what the reset meta turned out to be. It didn&#8217;t leave D&D with a lot of wiggle room for new, creative ideas, since so much effort had to be focused on balancing the game in a turbulent meta. Set 2 was entirely comprised of player cards, so no new themes could be created there either. All of this left many of us on D&D (and surely many of you) itching for something new in the game. And so we&#8217;ve arrived at Set 3.

In the early stages of Design for this set, Design Advocate Shewski decided he had to take some time away from the D&D process and entrusted Set 3 to the team of Design Interns, most of whom had been working on Design since around Legacy block 8. So there was plenty of experience in the room, and plenty of excitement to get creative and push some boundaries, while still keeping in mind what got us to the point we are at today.

The Advocates met and decided that Design needed one of the interns to take a leadership role on the set, and I am grateful that they chose me for Set 3. It meant that while I was doing the same thing as the other interns, I had to also be the annoying guy telling everybody to keep posting, commenting, and moving forward, while also breaking ties when there was disagreement. The entire D&D team did a commendable job in setting aside personal preferences, openly sharing and accepting criticism, and doing what we thought was best for the game. I can&#8217;t stress this point enough.

We all had a conference call to get on the same page about what we wanted in Set 3. Some broad ideas emerged, such as addressing the meta issues of starship weapons and landing claw, creating better support characters for light side, improving light side capital starships, and, since we were all of the opinion that dark side was stronger in general, one new theme for light side, along with some modest improvements to existing dark side platforms. All of these elements are still in Set 3. We also have made a concerted effort to be efficient, and not make any filler cards. Right now, the master list is at just 37 cards.

In designing the set, we also kept in mind many of the mantras of why the reset happened. Too many cards and modifiers all over the table; walls of text and using every millimeter of text boxes; ever-increasing power and destiny creep. We had to find what we thought would appeal to people of all opinions on the game. Only time will tell how we have done. But Scott was always there to remind us to be efficient and not waste designs to create an inflated card pool, and to spell out all icons on cards to avoid text creep.

As we wrapped up the initial designs for the set and gave them to development, our original ideas didn&#8217;t survive in their existing forms, as always happens. Development did a great job of reining us in, keeping cards balanced, and coming up with great improvements to our ideas.

Flash forward to today, and we&#8217;re currently in the middle of the 3rd round of playtesting. To date we have had very close to 100 games played with this set (yes, I have been keeping track since the start), and we&#8217;ve used the information given by playtesting in every one of these reports. Most of the set I feel is very close to being ready to go, and while we&#8217;re still working out the kinks in the new light side theme, as well as a few important characters (including a, ahem, controversial one that you all have already seen), we are excited for you all to see the finished product.

I&#8217;m sure many of you have been reading for some more specific information on the set, and I&#8217;ll give you 2 specific things right now. The first is a release date: we are going to be releasing Set 3 on Friday, December 4th. A full, pre-proofing blackout spoiler list should be available up to a week before that date.

Second, a few spoilers. These are some of the most widely praised cards so far from both D&D and playtesting, and they go together like fish and chips.

•Admiral Ackbar (V)  
[Set 3 &#8211; Death Star II &#8211; XR]  
CHARACTER &#8211; REBEL  
POWER 3 ABILITY 3 FORCE-ATTUNED  
Text: [Pilot]3: any capital starship. Deploys free aboard Home One. While piloting a Star Cruiser, adds one battle destiny. Where you have two Rebel capital starships, attrition against opponent is +2.  
DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 7  
[Pilot]  
Set Icon 3

•Rebel Leadership (V) 4  
[Set 3 &#8211; Death Star II &#8211; R]  
USED INTERRUPT  
Text: /\ an admiral or general. OR If your admiral is in battle at a system (or your general is in battle at a site), you may either add one battle destiny or prevent opponent from drawing more than one battle destiny.  
Set Icon 3

Ackbar makes the Home One good again, which is something that so far has been universally loved. Rebel Leadership helps bring it all together (and it also pulls an old General from the Clone Wars). I can also say that after this set, Ackbar will not be the only Admiral you can pull with this card. For those of you who may be afraid of pullable twixes, fear not &#8212; there are no plans to pull Home One: War Room to make this combo easier than it already is to set up.

I hope this post has been insightful for you all! Thanks for being active in the game, and I hope to see you battling it out with Set 3 at the MPC!
