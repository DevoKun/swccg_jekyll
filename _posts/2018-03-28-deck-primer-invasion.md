  * Sample Deck List

**General Description:**  
Invasion is a battle deck through and through. It likes to fight battles on the ground (not so much in space, but I&#8217;ll get to that), and the more it battles, the stronger it gets. Since your droids get recycled through Droid Racks, the destiny 8 blasters forfeit to used, and Dofine takes droids you draw for destiny into hand, more and more of your deck becomes rifles the longer the game goes on. So, regularly drawing battle destinies of 10-16 is not at all uncommon by the mid game.

The deck takes advantage of drawing 2 battle destiny if unable to otherwise combined with very high average destiny to cause huge attrition and clear sites. Because battle droids are very weak on their own, though (most are 2-3 power and draw no battle destiny), the deck plays lots of defensive battle tricks to keep the opponent from isolating a single droid and beating them down. Invasion also tends to put a lot on table and is very Force hungry. But, to counterbalance that, it also tends to lose very little life force once it&#8217;s set up, between Tey How reducing drains in space, and your droids and rifles recycling after clearing sites. If it can survive the early game without losing too much Force to early pressure or battles, Invasion can generally dominate the mid-to-late game.

**General Strategy:**  
Invasion can be very flexible in the hands of a skilled player. It&#8217;s good at battling away the opponent&#8217;s characters, of course, but if they refuse to engage, then it can also cause some major damage on its own by spreading out with blasters. Three drain-two sites and a drain-two system plus damage from YBD adds up quickly. The deck likes to flip, of course, but it doesn&#8217;t have to flip to win.

In space, your goal is not to win any battles, but simply to survive, drain for free, and flip if you can. If you get Imperial Justice(v) out, then a droid or two with a rifle should be enough to keep the battleship on the table (grab Darklighter Spin if they play it). Don&#8217;t be afraid to run away from Naboo system if you need to. When you do, your objective flips back, and Naboo reverts back to 2/0, which often means they&#8217;ll be paying for drains next turn. Between that and Tey How, you should almost never take damage from drains in space.

<strong class="text-strong">Setup:</strong> First turn, use any pullers you have for locations and droids, use your objective to deploy the Generator, and look for Dofine or Tey How while you&#8217;re in there. Which one you play using the battleship&#8217;s text depends on what your opponent is playing. If you&#8217;re facing a space-heavy deck (EBO, Y4Ops, HB), then definitely go with Tey. If you expect to fight more battles, then play Dofine, who gives you some extra activation and helps get your droids into hand. Then, draw some force after that and try to set up a good hand.

In general, you&#8217;re looking for 3 pieces in your hand in the next couple turns before you are ready to flip: a Nemoidian or a way to pull one, cards to protect you from a beatdown at the Throne Room, and enough forfeit fodder to at least make them think twice about attacking the battleship. You have numerous cards to help you in finding those pieces: Sidious and Maul w/ Phantom Menace help you pull Nemodians, WMAOP fetches Justice(v), There They Are! and Dofine pull your droids, and Point Man(v) / Force Push(v) get whatever else you&#8217;re missing.

From there on out, you want to initiate as many battles on the ground as you can without being forced to take battle damage. Your goal is not to out-power them, but to clear sites with massive attrition. Even a single B2 with a rifle can do a lot of damage: hit someone with the gun (forfeit -4), draw an 8 for battle destiny (and +1 to attrition), forfeit the rifle to used for 3 and the droid to Racks for 4, all for 6 force. Eventually, they&#8217;ll either run out of characters or leave themselves open to a beatdown.

<span style="font-size: 1rem">[wc_toggle title=&#8221;Key cards&#8221;]</span>

<strong class="text-strong">Characters</strong>  
Droids

  * [B2 Battle Droid](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/b2battledroid.gif){.postlink} &#8211; The mainstay of the deck. In general, you want droids that can draw BD even if you&#8217;re not flipped, and this one fits the bill perfectly. The +1 to attrition doesn&#8217;t hurt, either. One or two of these should be your first pull with There They Are!
  * [OOM-9 &#8211;](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/oom9.gif){.postlink}Cheap deploy and a pilot to add to power on the battleship.
  * [OWO-1 With Backup](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/owo1withbackup.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Expensive, but worth it if used in the right situation. If opponent invades your sites, stack him at the generator with some other droids, and opponent drains 0 at Swamp and Throne Room. Draws two BD even if not flipped.
  * [3B3-888](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/3b3888.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Pairs very well with weapons, since he reduces defense value by 3. Can draw BD if not flipped.
  * [Security Battle Droid](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/securitybattledroid.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Another droid that can draw BD if not flipped.
  * [Battle Droid Officer](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/battledroidofficer.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Even though he doesn&#8217;t draw BD when not flipped, moving your droids for free (especially OWO-1) is huge. +1 to total BD for more attrition, too.

Everyone Else

  * Lord Sidious &#8211; Pulling a Nemoidian gives you more flexibility for when to flip, and his exclusion text makes him ideal for defending the Throne Room. Some favorites to exclude: Screaming Lando, Leia and her blaster, Cassian, EPP Chewie, EPP Luke, or Anakin. If you open-hand him against a deck that gives you two icons, playing him to the generator first turn is not a bad play: power 7, immune to attrition, excludes a character, and threatens a drain of 2.
  * Lord Maul With Lightsaber &#8211; Can be a nasty surprise if held for the right time. Combos with TPM to find your Nemoidians.
  * [Tey How](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/teyhow.gif){.postlink} &#8211; The single biggest thorn in the side for decks like EBO. She can reduce drains all the way from Alderaan to Tatooine. Pull her instead of Dofine with the battleship if you anticipate space drains.
  * [Daultay Dofine](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/daultaydofine.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Taking droids drawn for destiny into hand both speeds up the deck and means that the droids&#8217; low destiny isn&#8217;t a liability. The extra activation of 2 sometimes comes in handy, but not frequently.

<strong class="text-strong">Tricksy Things</strong>  
Invasion plays lots of tricks to stay alive and turn the tables on the opponent.

Battle Interrupts

  * [Ghhhk & Those Rebels Won&#8217;t Escape Us](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/ghhhk&thoserebelswontescapeus.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Beatdown protection (obviously). Once you find one of these, you can play much more aggressively. Cancelling Nabrun or a react is great, too.
  * [Oh, Switch Off](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Hoth-Dark/ohswitchoff.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Protects against weapons, SATM in control phase, and Blaster Proficiency in battle. Helps make sure they can&#8217;t pick off one droid in a pair and beat up on the other one.
  * [Imbalance & Kintan Strider](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/imbalance&kintanstrider.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Also cancels Blaster Proficiency. Retrieving a character into hand doesn&#8217;t happen often, but it can be good if you top-deck a droid to a drain.
  * [Sniper & Dark Strike](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/sniper&darkstrike.gif){.postlink} &#8211; You play lots of weapons, so it&#8217;s an obvious fit. Undercover spy protection. You can also use it offensively to help setup a beatdown, or defensively to survive if they come at you where you have a rifle.
  * [Weapon Levitation](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/weaponlevitation.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Both portions of the card are very useful. Play it used to pull a just-forfeited rifle or Laser Cannon Battery back into hand for use next turn. Or, play it lost to have Gunray or a Dark Jedi steal a weapon as a nasty surprise. The Weapon Lev shield only works if they know you&#8217;re playing it. <img class="smilies" title="Wink" src="https://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" />
  * [Point Man(v)](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set5-Dark/pointman.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Cancels KYEO(v), which is quite prevalent right now (early 2018). Also, gives you a peek at your force pile to see if there&#8217;s anything there worth drawing to help you set up.

Utility Interrupts

  * [Force Push(v)](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/forcepush.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Primarily used to pull whatever you need and give yourself one extra Force on a crucial turn. The other function can be useful, too, although less frequently. Used defensively, it can cancel a beatdown on a lone Sidious or Maul. Used offensively, Maul can slice someone, and then cancel the battle before they can draw BD.
  * [There They Are!](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/theretheyare.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Pulls your B2&#8217;s and officers. An easily cyclable 5 destiny card.
  * Sonic Bombardment(v) &#8211; Pulls your activation. After that, it&#8217;s a good candidate to be put back with Point Man(v) in draw phase or pitch to a drain.
  * [We Must Accelerate Our Plans](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/wemustaccelerateourplans.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Pulls activation, and pulls effects (I usually go for Bridge first, then Imp Justice).

Effects

  * [Inconsequential Losses](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/inconsequentiallosses.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Lets you forfeit the rifles to used (even if the droid carrying it is a passenger on the battleship) for 3. Works even if the droid itself was forfeit = 0 from a lightsaber. Also lets you do the same for the Laser Cannon Battery.
  * [An Entire Legion Of My Best Troops](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Endor-Dark/anentirelegionofmybesttroops.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Solely there to add 2 to destiny of all your rifles. Drawing 8&#8217;s is great.
  * [Imperial Justice(v)](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/imperialjustice.gif){.postlink} &#8211; You almost always want this card on table, and it&#8217;s critical in some matchups. OWO-1 and the flipside of your objective let you draw 2 BD even if you use Justice, since they say &#8220;if unable to otherwise.&#8221; The attrition boosts from Battle Droid Officer and B2 Battle Droid also get around Justice. Be aware, though, that using Justice means Entire Legion can&#8217;t boost your rifles&#8217; destiny in that battle.
  * [Crush The Rebellion](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/crushtherebellion.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Clash Of Sabers gives this deck fits, so this can be an alternate start instead of YBD against decks that play lots of sabers, like Profit, HITCO, or TRM (since TRM goes first, you see their effects before you choose yours, so look for Sai&#8217;torr or LMFBM when deciding what to start).

<strong class="text-strong">61st Cards</strong>

  * [Masterful Move & Endor Occupation](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/masterfulmove&endoroccupation.gif){.postlink} &#8211; cancels celebrations and Savrip. Savrip is particularly bad, since much of your advantage in this deck comes from the fact that your characters come back and theirs get cleared.
  * [Evader & Monnok](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/evader&monnok.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Could be worth it with Crush and MM combo.
  * [A Day Long Remembered(v)](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/adaylongremembered.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Reduce opponent&#8217;s immunity, and cause more force loss when they lose battles or Jedi. Most of your characters don&#8217;t have immunity, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt you. A cyclable 6, too.
  * [Stunning Leader](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Dark/stunningleader.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Most of your droids are immune to it. Can be used defensively to end a battle against high-ability characters, or offensively to exclude everyone but some poor ability-2 mook, and just wail on him.
  * [Self-destruct Mechanism](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Hoth-Dark/selfdestructmechanism.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Forfeiting a droid to satisfy all attrition can be nice, especially since the deck is very Force hungry, so you don’t have to spend a ton of force next turn redploying all the droids. Combos well with Oh, Switch Off to retarget opponent&#8217;s weapons away from Gunray, Maul, and Sidious.
  * [Probot](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/probot.gif){.postlink} &#8211; This deck doesn’t have too many ways of dealing with opponent’s undercover spies other than Sniper and this guy. Downside is he doesn’t have very good destiny, and is a bit expensive in a deck that’s as force-hungry as Invasion is. Probably a meta call.
  * A second Justice(v) &#8211; You really, really want this card on table most games, so having two makes it easier.
  * [DFS Squadron Starfighter](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/dfssquadronstarfighter.gif){.postlink} / [Droid Starfighter Laser Cannons](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Dark/droidstarfighterlasercannons.gif){.postlink} &#8211; An alternative to stacking the battleship with droids and rifles for forfeit fodder. The starfighters are pullable with There They Are!, and they pull their own cannons every turn, which can be forfeited to used with Inconsequential Losses.
  * [IG-88 In IG-2000](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/ig88inig2000.gif){.postlink} &#8211; One of the few ways to get more than one battle destiny in space with this deck. Can add it if the meta is more space heavy.

Cards to Look Out For and Their Counters

  * [Clash of Sabers](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/clashofsabers.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Since most of your characters need to be paired with at least one other character to draw those crushing battle destinies, the deck is very vulnerable to getting one droid excluded and the other beaten down on. Crush the Rebellion is a hard counter to this, and can be started in matches involving lots of sabers (Profit, HITCO, TRM, possibly WYS).
  * [Sorry About the Mess](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Light/sorryaboutthemess.gif){.postlink} / [Blaster Proficiency](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/blasterproficiency.gif){.postlink} / [Leia’s Blaster Rifle](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Light/leiasblasterrifle.gif){.postlink} &#8211; For the same reason that Clash is bad, anything that immediately removes characters before or during battle hurts, too. Oh, Switch Off is a key card to counter this. Against Blaster Prof or Leia’s Rifle, Weapon Lev can also steal the weapon before they get a chance to use it. The fact that Inconsequential Losses then lets you forfeit the stolen Leia’s Blaster for 3 just rubs further salt in the wound.
  * [Nabrun Leids](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/nabrunleids.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Profit and its ilk will often go for Nabrun beatdowns if they see the opportunity. Ghhhk combo cancels it, though.
  * [Mantellian Savrip](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/mantelliansavrip.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Invasion relies on clearing sites with huge attrition and recursing your characters, while theirs stay lost, and Savrip ruins that. Masterful Move combo cancels it, so include that if you expect to see Savrip.
  * [Bacta Tank](https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Hoth-Light/bactatank.gif){.postlink} &#8211; Causes similar problems to Savrip, but not as bad, since they can only save one character and they have to pay to pull them off. Alter can help, but you don’t have many high ability characters to use it with. Often, you’ll just have to play around it and try to clear multiple characters in a battle, so they can’t save all of them.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Light/watchyourstep.gif">Watch Your Step</a> (WYS)</strong>

  * WYS is a heavy control deck relies on playing multiple strong interrupts from hand and lost pile.
  * They generally control the Cantina with Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight for sizable drains.
  * Their space is much better than yours and should be avoided for as long as possible.

      <strong class="text-strong">What WYS does well against Invasion:</strong></p> 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Luke in the Cantina with his lightsaber threatens a drain of 3 for early pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kessel drain can not be reduced by Tey How unless you’re sitting at Tatooine, since it’s 3 parsecs away.
        </li>
        <li>
          Powerful lost interrupts and replaying them from lost means you have to be careful when engaging them, since what you see is frequently not what you get with WYS.

        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against WYS:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tey How kills their drains at Tatooine system
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of your locations are battlegrounds, so Invasion doesn’t really mind the force choke from filpped WYS all that much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flipping your objective means placing interrupts they draw for battle destiny out of play. If you can stay flipped, this can add up to quite a few cards that they lose and can’t replay from lost pile.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <strong class="text-strong">General Strategy:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Kill luke. You have a lot of ground battle tricks, and you cause lots of attrition. The more Invasion battles, the stronger it becomes. Eventually, they will probably run out of characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be prepared to avoid space when they come after you. There will be at least three systems on the board, and they likely won’t have enough ships to put a really strong force at all of them. A few droids on the battleship should be enough to survive and keep running. If they chase you to Tatooine, Tey How can nullify the Kessel drain, too.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may want to consider starting Crush instead of YBD to counter Clash of Sabers.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m honestly not sure if this matchup favors Invasion or WYS, not having played it enough times myself.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Light/quietminingcolony.gif">Quiet Mining Colony</a> (QMC)</strong>

  * QMC generally wants to hold Bespin and spread out with a bunch of cheap, weaker characters in order to maximize their drain damage and retrieval from Cloud City Celebration.

<div>
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="quotecontent">
    <div>
      <strong class="text-strong">What QMC does well against Invasion:</strong></p> 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unreducible drains where they have an alien means OWO-1 With Backup doesn’t help much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large retrieval (Cloud City Celebration, Luke Skywalker(v), and possibly Off the Edge)
        </li>
        <li>
          Lots of tricks to avoid battles and dance around your droids (It’s A Trap!, Barrier, Path, Dodge).
        </li>
        <li>
          Bespin makes dark side’s characters deploy +1 to all their sites, which means Invasion is going to be mildly force choked all game.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against QMC:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Like Invasion, QMC takes a few turns to get setup properly, so you tend to have some breathing room to find the pieces you want and attack them before then.
        </li>
        <li>
          QMC tends to keep to their own locations, so they won’t likely contest your flip right away. Watch out for a mid-to-late-game Nabrun beatdown, though, and hang onto a Ghhhk combo to cancel it.
        </li>
        <li>
          QMC plays a ton of interrupts, so if battles are happening, your flipped objective will likely be placing a lot of their cards out of play.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <strong class="text-strong">General Strategy:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Invade Cloud City early and heavily. Depending on your opening hand, it might even be worth attacking before you flip, to put the early pressure on. They’ll have lots of ways to avoid you at first, but many of those are lost interrupts, and you will eventually burn through them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be careful where you deploy your droids. QMC has a habit of cancelling your beatdown and then moving away, stranding you at the wrong end of the site line. If you can make a couple of battles go through, you can stack your droids on racks and then redeploy them somewhere else next turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rather than going for large beatdowns, try to force battles at as many locations as possible, to burn through their avoidance cards quicker. Once battles start to go through, your attrition and weapons will quickly clear their characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shoot Pucumir Thryss if at all possible. Once he’s gone, QMC’s damage output goes way down.
        </li>
        <li>
          Masterful Move combo cancels Celebration. They’ll likely retrieve it, but even keeping it off the table for a turn or two can be big.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can be tricky deciding what to grab. It Could Be Worse is always a good candidate. Path of Least Resistance or Rebel Barrier could also be good. Just resign yourself to the fact that, no matter what you grab, they’ll abuse all the other interrupts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Invasion should be favored in this matchup, assuming you play carefully and can cancel Celebration. Invading Cloud City will eventually wear them down.

  * Diplo involves taking a few turns to flip by moving the death star plans to Alderaan. After they will want to spread out on Tatooine to maximize their drain damage and bonus to total battle destiny granted by their objective.

          Some variants play Mantellian Savrip, which kills your attrition and makes it very difficult to clear their characters off sites. Play Masterful Move combo to cancel it.

        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against Diplo:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Diplo plays at least three systems of their own (Tatooine, Chandrilla, and Alderaan). They generally don’t have enough ships to cover all those systems with a beat squad, so once they do come to Naboo, you can keep running back and forth between systems, reducing their space drains with Tey How all game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Diplo takes several turns to setup, during which time you should be able to flip relatively safely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Diplo’s space tends to be composed mainly of mini-capital ships with lots of good pilots (Bright Hope, Spiral, Tantive, etc.), so Laser Cannon Battery can be quite potent against them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <strong class="text-strong">General Strategy:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Like Invasion, Diplo is built to initiate lots of battles. Unlike Invasion, though, Diplo can’t recurse its many characters (unless running Savrip). Keep clearing their characters, and they’ll eventually run out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to flip as soon as reasonably possible, but make sure to put a little forfeit fodder on the battleship first, as they can come down with a few powerful ships once Naboo is a battleground.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for a Ghhhk early if possible. You can battle much more aggressively once you’re not worried about leaving one droid stranded at a site after a battle.
        </li>
        <li>
          This matchup should slightly favor Invasion, since your characters come back, while theirs do not. Diplo isn’t built to try and avoid battles at sites, and you can trade characters at a better ratio than they can.

        </li>
        <li>
          Very strong space means you need to be careful when you flip to avoid a beatdown.

        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against EBO:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tey How is worth her weight in gold here, as she can neuter the majority of their drains.
        </li>
        <li>
          To maximize its damage, EBO plays lots of systems, which means they don’t generally have enough ships to place a strong force at all of them. Your battleship should be able to run pretty effectively once they commit to a board position.
        </li>
        <li>
          EBO generally plays speeders to defend the ground, which means you can spread to your interior sites and race them for damage. YBD helps increase your damage potential, too.
        </li>
        <li>
          EBO puts a lot of cards on table, which means you don’t have to have as much damage go through to cripple them as against some other decks.
        </li>
        <li>
          EBO gives away lots of icons, so you should have plenty of force to pay for what you need.
        </li>

        <strong class="text-strong">General Strategy:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the battleship’s text to deploy Tey How instead of Dofine. EBO’s usual game plan is to spread out in space and drain if unopposed, which doesn’t work here, because of Tey How.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble the pieces to flip quickly, but wait for the flip until they’ve committed to a board position in space. EBO does hardly any damage until it starts up the space drains. Once they’ve deployed ships to drain you, then you can flip with less fear of reprisal at Naboo.
        </li>
        <li>
          If they deploy to 4th marker early, and you think you can clear them, then go for it, because making them pay for drains is huge. But, also be prepared to lose whatever droids you play there to Ice Storm next turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          This matchup heavily favors Invasion, due mostly to Tey How letting you win the damage race.

  * Old Allies is an extremely defensive control deck seeking to control Jakku, deal modest drains, and reduce destinies during battle.
  * Starts with a free, unpiloted Falcon that can play as both a combat vehicle as well as a starship. Pulling Rey, General Leia, and General Lando from reserve deck means they can field a strong ship turn 1 every game.
  * Has significant deployment restrictions (no Lukes or Jedi) that typically forces most OA players to rely more on pilots, speeders, and General Leia.

      <strong class="text-strong">What OA does well against Invasion:</strong></p> 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          OA packs a huge variety of defensive tricks, and once flipped, can reduce any destiny during battle by 2. They also play many anti-weapon cards (KYEO(v), Antilles Maneuver(v), Wesa, Theron Nett, etc.), so don’t expect to hit with your blasters or Laser Cannon Battery much at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being able to build a super-Falcon turn 1 most games (and pull Profundity) gives you very little breathing room before your battleship is attacked.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against OA:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tey How helps nullify some drains as long as the battleship survives.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are usually only two systems in play: Naboo and Jakku, so if you can kick them off the ground, Come Here You Big Coward can keep them from draining at Naboo, even if you lose the battleship.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many OA builds currently play speeders on the ground, which provide high immunity to attrition and weapons protection from lightsabers. Fortunately, Invasion doesn’t care about either of those things. If you can stay flipped (a big “if”), then you should be able to crack their immunity with 2 battle destinies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Imperial Justice gives you some breathing room in space, but it won’t last forever. If you’re willing to risk stacking the throne room, it might even make sense to start Justice in this matchup instead of YBD.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <strong class="text-strong">General Strategy:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is a very challenging matchup for Invasion. It’ll be an uphill battle all the way, due to OA’s strong space force and few systems to run to. You’ll usually see the Falcon, Home One and Profundity, along with strong pilots like Poe, Ackbar, and Wedge RSL.
        </li>
        <li>
          One alternative is to try and flip as early as possible, before they come to Naboo with the super-Falcon. Expect OA to move over on their second or third turn, though, so you don’t have much time to set up. If you can stay flipped for a few turns, you should be able to make a sizable dent in their ground force.
        </li>
        <li>
          The other alternative is to simply abandon space altogether, and focus on kicking them off of sites. This can work, too, but with only drawing one battle destiny instead of two, and OA reducing your destiny constantly, it is much harder.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is one matchup I haven’t consistently figured out yet. If anyone in the community has further ideas, feel free to post in the comments section below.

  * TRM is typically extremely ground heavy with multiples of LSJK, multiple weapon-wielding EPPs, and a variety of interrupts to assist in winning battles. At the time of this writing, it is the single most common LS deck for competitive play.

      <ul>
        <li>
          TRM goes first and gives away no icons, while Invasion gives away a lot of icons (4 if not flipped, 6 when flipped).
        </li>
        <li>
          Plays lots of battle interrupts that can setup beatdowns and multiple Senses to cancel your defensive interrupts.

        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against TRM:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          TRM doesn’t tend to play a whole lot of space and probably won’t be able to play any of it until you flip unless they draw Corran, due to not running a system of their own. This means you can put a little forfeit fodder on the battleship and mostly focus on contesting the ground.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of the action will be on Naboo, which means you don’t have to split your forces between protecting the throne room and battling their characters. In fact, the throne room will likely see a lot of battling in this matchup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other than LSJK, not many of their characters have significant immunity to attrition, so they’ll tend to die to your battle destinies. Since your characters come back and theirs don’t, if you can keep from getting beaten down in the early game, you should be able to run them out of characters for the win.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lord Sidious shines here as a defensive character, since he can exclude one of their characters, making it much more difficult to assault the throne room.
        </li>

        <strong class="text-strong">General Strategy:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start Crush instead of YBD, to take away their ability to use Clash. You won’t be controlling many battlegrounds with blasters this game anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for a Ghhhk as soon as possible, just in case.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t deploy to the ground before you’re good and ready to flip, because they’re likely to try to beat you down as soon as you show your face at a site. If you’re lucky enough to draw the throne room, don’t play it until you’re ready to flip. If they do go to the throne room before you do, then look for OWO-1 with backup and stack him and some others at the Generator. Unless they have Padme or a lightsaber, they’ll be committing a lot of characters to holding a drain-0 site.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you’re able to draw two battle destiny several battles in a row (either via flipping your objective or with OWO-1), you should clear a lot of their characters. Droid Racks means you can redeploy your lost characters to wherever they’re needed most on any given turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since you don’t get any icons from TRM, careful management of your available force will be key. Daultay Dofine’s activate 2 text is handy here.
        </li>
        <li>
          In my opinion, this matchup favors the Invasion player, since TRM can’t meaningfully contest you in space, and your characters recurse while theirs do not. As long as you play carefully and avoid getting beaten down, they will eventually run out of characters.

  * Like TRM, Hitco is typically extremely ground heavy with multiples of LSJK, some weapon-wielding EPPs, and a variety of interrupts to assist in winning battles.

      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          HITCO is slightly slower to set up than TRM, which plays into Invasion’s favor, since it gives Invasion more time to find all the pieces it needs. Most of the things that apply to the TRM matchup also apply to HITCO.
        </li>
        <li>
          HITCO plays even less space than TRM usually does, so you’re probably pretty safe in space. This means you can put a little forfeit fodder on the battleship and mostly focus on contesting the ground.

        <li>
          If they go to the throne room ahead of you, they’re probably going to try and set up a deathball of characters there along with Leia of Alderaan(v) to make their big drain unmodifiable. If they deploy the Battle Plains, you can ignore them and set up Resistance on the rest of Naboo to limit the damage. If they are smart and don’t play the BP, you may have to contest the throne room. The good news is Invasion can usually win a protracted battle over a single site due to recurring characters, if it goes in prepared.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you’re able to draw two battle destiny several battles in a row (either via flipping your objective or with OWO-1), you should clear a lot of their characters. Droid Racks means you can redeploy your lost characters to wherever they’re needed most on any given turn.

      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Profit generally has little to no space, so you can play Dofine to the battleship and focus exclusively on the ground.
        </li>
        <li>
          Profit does very little damage until they release Han, so you have a turn or two where they’ll be stacking their hand, giving you time to set up yours, as well.

          Ghhhk combo cancels Nabrun

        <li>
          Profit has a bit of an identity crisis in this matchup. On the one hand, they want to rescue Han, since that’s how they do their damage, but to do that they need to commit a significant force to the Audience Chamber or risk you battling Han away. On the other hand, they really want to keep you from flipping as the 2 BD each battle will eventually ruin them, but doing that requires committing to the throne room. The only way they can shuttle guys from one theater to another is Nabrun, which you can cancel with Ghhhk combo (just watch out for Sense).
        </li>
        <li>
          Profit’s effectiveness goes down after the first battle or two, so if you can survive the first beatdown, you should be able to win.

        </li>
        <li>
          Just like the line from the mooooovies … let them make the first move. Or, at least don’t feel pressured to flip early if they aren’t putting any pressure on you. If they commit enough guys to taking the throne room early, let them take it and go to the generator and swamp. If their characters are tied up at a drain 1 site, they can’t use them elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          If they free Han right away, that’s even better, since they will have less to commit to beating you down on Naboo, and you can attack them wherever they’re weakest in subsequent turns as they try to spread to up the damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you do decide to go to the throne room, you will probably need to stack the site with a bunch of characters, just to make sure at least two of them survive to draw battle destiny.
        </li>
        <li>
          This matchup tends to be swingy. If you can stack your hand with defensive cards early enough and avoid the initial beatdown, the match is easily winnable. If not, you likely get blown out badly.

          Don’t try to flip, but instead spread as fast as you reasonably can to put early pressure on while they’re setting up. Not flipping will keep Naboo a non-battleground, which will keep them from deploying there and shooting you lost with Power Pivot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run as long as you can with the battleship, reducing drains with Tey How. Don’t move in front of their ships if possible. Make them chase you while you probe.

<strong class="text-strong">Yavin 4 Base Operations Space (Y4O Space)</strong>

  * Y4O generally plays as a space only or mix between space and ground. When flipped and a system has been liberated, they&#8217;re able to retrieve 1 force per turn (often in addition to Luke Skywalker (V) retrieval).
  * Y4O typically relies on matching ships and usually at least 1 X-Wing Laser Cannon.
  * The most popular version plays matching ships and EPPs. Typically, this version will play a ship very early to Nar Shada to threaten a drain of 3 with an initial force loss 1. Will Also play EPPs, Jedi&#8217;s Resilience, and 2 Clash of Sabers to potentially contest sites on the ground.
  * Some versions bunker Yavin 4 by creating a group of ships and a group of characters at the Yavin 4 system (with Haven) and the Yavin 4 Docking Bay.
  * Some versions play only space and use Haven to cheaply flood systems with matching ships (as well make it much easier to pay to drain in space)

      <strong class="text-strong">What Y4O Space does well against Invasion:</strong></p> 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Strong ships that can definitely outpower your space. Even with Imperial Justice(v), they can eventually force you into bad battles in space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enough of a ground presence to make it difficult to kick them off of sites entirely, especially without being able to flip.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reducing boosted space drains with Tey How quickly gets expensive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra power on the ground from the flipped objective adds up quickly, and makes winning battles much more difficult.

          Drains at nearby systems can be reduced with Tey How.

          Your recurring droids may be able to kick them off the ground.

          Honestly, this is a very difficult matchup for Invasion, perhaps the hardest one out there right now. If anyone has any suggestions on how to better handle this one, I’m open to hearing them.

<strong class="text-strong"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Light/wehaveaplan.gif">We Have A Plan</a> (WHAP)</strong>

  * WHAP is an Episode 1 Objective based on the retaking of the Naboo Palace Throne Room.
  * Has significant deployment restrictions and can only use aliens, episode 1 Jedi, and republic characters.
  * When in control of the throne room, WHAP deals 2 damage per battleground occupied by Padme or Panaka. Also, they gain the obtain to cancel any battle destiny >3 by spending 1 force.
  * Typically plays a variety of Naboo fighters and the Naboo system. Against most decks, they have the potential to drain for 3 as well as remove ships during their control phase with Let’s Try Spinning.

        <strong class="text-strong">What Invasion does well against WHAP:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Invasion cancels their icons at Naboo, and WHAP can’t play spy pilots, so they can’t deploy any space, which means they have a lot of dead cards and are paying for drains.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sidious can help tremendously, by excluding Jerus Jannick from battles at the throne room.
        </li>
        <li>
          OWO-1 with backup still draws 2 if unable to otherwise, even if not flipped. Find him as soon as possible.

**When Does the Meta Favor Invasion?**  
Since Invasion is capable of generating huge amounts of attrition on the ground, it is a good answer to mains (especially immunity mains) and speeder decks, since they tend to rely on it being difficult to break their attrition. It quite handily gets around destiny limiting, too (Evac Control(v), Rebel Leadership(v), Combined Fleet Action), since it so often draws two if unable to otherwise. So, if those decks and cards are popular, Invasion may be a good meta choice.

Where Invasion struggles more is against decks that play few enough systems and enough ships to force it into a prolonged slugfest in space, while still being able to occupy a battleground site. Decks like OA and Y4O Space have enough ships to come at Invasion at Naboo system early on, and make it impossible to flip. Justice will let you hold out for a few turns, but eventually, Invasion is usually forced to either abandon space and pay for drains, or spend a huge amount of Force each turn just restocking the battleship with droids to forfeit. Adding more space or Search And Destroy may make these matchups somewhat more even, but they’ll always be a challenge.
