Hi everyone,

This fortnight, I’m turning things over to you, the readers. I asked people to send me their game stories from Local Tournament Weekend, so that we could all read them and learn from each other. Without further ado:

**#1: Don’t bet the farm on one tactic, and remember what your cards do. –by WayneWTP**

I had a [TIGIH](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/thereisgoodinhim.gif) deck that I had assembled around [Kanan Jarrus](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/kananjarrus.gif). The general concensus of the deck is that Kanan cancels immunity to attrition so it is full of Kanan and EPP characters to hit hard and fast and not worry about losing their own immunity to attrition as they have none to lose. What I discovered to my cost is that immunity to attrition makes holding a site SOOOO much easier than just flooding it with otherwise tough characters.

Another discovery was the horrible combination that the Dark side can muster fairly easily. In one particular game my opponent put down [Dooku](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/countdooku.gif) and [Maul Lone Hunter](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Dark/darthmaullonehunter.gif) with his [double Saber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/maulsdoublebladedlightsaber.gif). A rather tough duo to say the least. I attempted to counter this with; Kanan, [EPP Han](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Light/hanwithheavyblasterpistol.gif), [EPP Leia](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Light/leiawithblasterrifle.gif) and [Chewie with Bowcaster EPP](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/chewiewithbowcaster.gif) (I had a good hand and force saved up). My thinking was that Dooku cannot [force lightning](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/forcelightning.gif) me to make me lost (due to Kanan cancelling his immunity to attrition so he has none to lose in order to use the lost part of Force Lightning&#8217;s gametext) and that I would be getting 3 battle destiny (one from ability, 1 from EPP Leia being Han and 1 from EPP Han being with Chewie). I kicked off the battle, shot with Chewie and missed. I then played [Slight Weapons Malfunction](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Light/slightweaponsmalfunction.gif) to have 4 battle destiny and was already anticipating the battle result. But then my opponent targeted Kanan with Maul, hit him and then played [Sniper](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/sniper&darkstrike.gif) to make him immediately lost. I then tried shooting with Leia, and missed. Now that Kanan was gone, Dooku was free to Force Lightning Chewie and make him immediately lost. Han then missed with his shot. Then he played [Set For Stun](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/control&setforstun.gif) and returned Leia to my hand. Suddenly I&#8217;d gone from having 4 powerful characters, and 4 battle destiny to just having Han there on his own and drawing zero battle destiny.

A few things I learned was that although the immunity to attrition cancelling is powerful, putting all your eggs in that one basket is dangerous as if anything happens to the basket then you&#8217;re screwed as your game plan goes out the window. Secondly I learned that the only decent way to hit powerful characters is with Lightsabers as ability 6 and 7 is a tough defence value to beat.

However, the biggest lesson I learned was that when I start with [K&#8217;lor Slug (v)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/klorslug.gif) then I have to remember what it does&#8230;

**#2: Save enough in your Reserve Deck for everything you want to do (and don’t waste your Ghhhk combo). –by quickdraw3457**

Time is called in our game and I&#8217;m on the last turn as LS. My brother has 3 bounty hunters at a site, and I have [Obi-wan (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Light/obiwankenobi.gif), [endor commando team](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/endorrcommandoteam.gif), [general solo (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/generalsolo.gif), and [Crix](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Endor-Light/generalcrixmadine.gif) at another site. I know I have a 5 and 6 in my reserve deck, [nabrun](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/nabrunleids.gif) in hand, [yoda](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set2-Light/yodakeeperofthepeace.gif) and [jedi presence](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/jedipresence.gif) in hand. He has one more [ghhhk combo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/ghhhk&thoserebelswontescapeus.gif) I know, and my plan is to nabrun everyone over, hope he plays ghhhk combo on my nabrun, [sense](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Light/sense.gif) it, and beat him down. Well, I forgot to leave an extra destiny for sense, so I ended up drawing the 6 for sense and since obi was my only jedi, it failed.

Lesson learned:  
Deploy yoda before sensing!  
Always remember to keep enough destinies for everything you want to do! I saved a destiny for nabrun but forgot to account for the sense draw.

My brother got away with one but I made sure he left with another lesson &#8212; in that situation, don&#8217;t blow your ghhhk combo on the nabrun that would cause you to play a ghhhk anyway. Just play it safe and use the ghhhk function in the battle.

**#3: Maintain a good space/ground balance; a good opponent will hit you where you’re weakest. –by dx_37**

During my game with Steve, I was playing [IE](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/imperialentanglements.gif) and he was running [OA](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/oldallies.gif). I knew how tough the [Home One](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/homeone.gif) [package](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Light/admiralackbar.gif) and [Solo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/solo.gif)/[Rey](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/rey.gif) on the [Falcon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/thefalconjunkyardgarbage.gif) could be. I also knew how important it was to hold space in order to get the [occupation](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/tatooineoccupation.gif) going. For this, I loaded up the [Devastator](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/devastator.gif) and disrupted his space early on. However, while I was concentrating on space, he was able to get set up on the ground and keep me on the 0 side for nearly the whole game. I had been holding an [Imperial Command](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Dark/imperialcommand.gif) for most of the game anticipating a showdown in space. In hindsight, I should have used the Command much earlier to get [General Veers (v)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/generalveers.gif) and start setting up a stronger ground game because I was already quite formidable in space. This is compounded by the fact that I had [Imperial Justice (v)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/imperialjustice.gif) going with an Imperial Command on it!

**#4: Look a few moves ahead; don’t spend Force on half-measures when you have a better play available. –by mrfrommars**

On his turn, I have Dooku with his lightsaber, and [Dr. E combo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/drevazan&pondababa.gif), at his [Bunker](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Light/endorbunker.gif) where he has a bunch of scouts. I have 2 Force saved, and both [Force Push (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/forcepush.gif) and [Imperial Barrier](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/imperialbarrier.gif) in my hand. He plays [Clash Of Sabers](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/clashofsabers.gif) to exclude Dr. E, then deploys another character. I Barrier, but he battles anyway and overflows Dooku.

If I hadn’t Barriered, I could’ve Force Pushed to end the battle, which would’ve been a much better play. I should’ve looked a move ahead before I Barriered, and realized that cancelling the battle was the better play.

**#5: Be patient. –by Wend**

If I had to go back to the weekend, deploying General Crix Madine and [Lieutenant Blount](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/DeathStarII-Light/lieutenantblount.gif) to Coruscant to flip [ISB](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/isboperations.gif) was a mistake. I should have held him for a turn and reinforced Blount with more characters than simply Madine. Yes, I would have eaten a drain of 7-8, but I ended up eating a smaller drain and an overflow of 7 from the ensuing battle anyway. It shows the importance of patience: eat the smaller damage in the now to prevent greater damage in the future. It Is The Future You See was never more apt.

And finally&#8230;

**#6: Watch out for Monnok/Grimtaash! –by Xanth**

When you can’t play around [Monnok](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Dark/monnok.gif)/[Grimtaash](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Light/grimtaash.gif), pray to the old gods and the new that they don’t have it!

Thanks to all who sent in their stories. I’m going to try to do this every once in a while, so keep them coming!

**Card of the Fortnight**

This fortnight, I’m going to highlight a new card that creates a new way to play [Carbon Chamber Testing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/carbonchambertesting.gif):

Boba Fett’s Blaster Rifle (V)

This card allows you to do an [Any Methods Necessary](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/anymethodsnecessary.gif) start with a non-maintenance Boba Fett, the gun, and even [Slave I](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/slaveisymboloffear.gif) if you want to. You deploy Boba Fett with the gun, seize [Jabba’s Prize](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlists/images/starwars/ReflectionsII-Dark/large/jabbasprizefront.gif), then zip over to the [Audience Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/jabbaspalaceaudiencechamber.gif) to flip your objective.

If you use your Audience Chamber pull on [Daroe (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set2-Dark/daroe.gif), you can set up [IG-88 (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/ig88.gif) there as well. It takes a little longer than starting IG-88 (V) by himself, but you get the added bonuses of flipping your objective:

-once-per-turn retrieval  
-pulling [Scum And Villainy](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/scumandvillainy.gif) without relying on [Jabba The Hutt (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/jabbathehutt.gif) (meaning you can run a different Jabba)  
-immunity to attrition for your aliens  
-bonuses for having Jabba’s Prize (v or non-v) at the Audience Chamber

I’m excited to see what people come up with for this new flip version of CCT. And if you haven’t figured it out yet, I’m spoiling my virtual card:

  * Boba Fett&#8217;s Blaster Rifle (V)  
    [Set 5 &#8211; Cloud City &#8211; R]  
    WEAPON &#8211; CHARACTER WEAPON  
    Text: Deploy on your non-[Maintenance] bounty hunter. If on Boba Fett, once per game, during your move phase, may use 2 Force to relocate him (with any captive he is escorting) to a [Jabba&#8217;s Palace] site. May target a character or vehicle for free. Draw destiny. Target hit if destiny +2 > defense value.  
    Set 5

That’s it for this fortnight. Until next time…

Peace, Love, and High Destinies,
