Set 9 – Full Spoiler  
Star Wars CCG-ers:  
We’ve just received information that the Empire is building a terrible weapon. We don’t believe the weapon is fully operational yet, but our intelligence shows that there is a major weapons test scheduled soon. We need to mobilize our spies, to strike from a hidden base to achieve our first victory against the Galactic Empire. With the Jedi exterminated, we can no longer rely on them to save the day. We must be covert and gather our spy network to get to the planet Scarif and learn more about this weapon.

And don’t worry – I will be joining you on this mission. Cassian said I had to…

Well, at long last the hard word of the design and development team, play testers, the proofing team, and the Advocates is almost ready to drop on you like decimated Jedah City temple. Themed for the time period between Episodes III and IV, this set explores the start of the Rebellion and the early stages of the Emperor’s super weapon (so lets just show you an inkling of its destructive power to give you just a small taste of the Ultimate Power In The Universe…). There are appearances by Rebel guerrillas (who specialize in taking down trooper assaults) and Rebel spies (who specialize in sabotaging the Empire’s plans, including their secret weapon). And it all helps set up the delivery of the weakness ready to be found that will allow a young farmboy to fly around space and become the Rebellion’s Hope. And of course there will be a smattering of other themes (from Black Sun helpers to help for some Old Allies) and powerful new characters that may be a hint of things to come (long live the Supreme Leader!).

So, without further ado, the whole D&D teams and the Advocates are happy to present Virtual Set 9! We hope you enjoy these cards and come up with creative new ways to enjoy our game!

(Oh and usual disclaimer applies – these cards are not yet finalized until fully proofed and released and remain subject to change… but wait until you see what graphics has in store for you guys! They keep setting the bar higher for themselves and keep delivering. The work they have done so far makes 10 cards feel like a 100!)

Oh – and lets not get ahead of ourselves, but before anyone asks about any potential plans for the next set, I think it is time… for the speculation… to end [cue dramatic music and red lettering]…
