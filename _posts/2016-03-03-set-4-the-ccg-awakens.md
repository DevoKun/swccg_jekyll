Greetings, Star Wars players!

A little over a month ago, we all got to see Episode 7 for the first time. I was able to go with Matt Carulli and had a great time playing hooky from work and being transported back to my childhood.

Before it came out, the design team and I had been discussing what we should do with Episode 7. The plan going in was to have a few marquee characters in the next set (which Jarad is leading) but to really wait a little later to bring it fully into the game. That plan, for me, was derailed at approximately 12:20 pm when the opening crawl finished.

Set 4 is now going to be focusing on the opening third of _The Force Awakens_. We aren&#8217;t going full TFA, but it&#8217;s pretty close. We were struck by the potential of Rey, specifically her being a scavenger, and Jakku being the site of a major battle between the Rebels and the Empire- so expect to see a new theme that revolves around Jakku and it being a &#8220;wreckage&#8221; planet. We are very close to releasing cards to testing.

Let&#8217;s talk about what you will see on cards overall. First, you will see an Episode 7 icon on all era-appropriate cards. You will not be seeing an Episode 8 or 9 icon. Much like we have done with the Episode I icon, in basically expanding it to refer to a trilogy era, we plan to use the Episode 7 icon to refer to the entirety of the sequel trilogy. This was done for a few reasons, but one that I particularly like is that we plan to have more Episode 7 content in future sets. As such, it gets unwieldy to say &#8220;Set 4, 5, or 6 characters&#8221; and we think its valuable to have some way to refer to all characters of a given era (like we do with Ep1).

Second, and this ties back into the era discussion above, is that we are debuting new icons for characters &#8211; Resistance and First Order. These are full icons, not subtypes. This took a little longer to reach a decision on, but I think it is the most consistent with what we have done with the game in the past, and what groundwork we set for the future.

If you look at the game as 3 eras (prequel, original, sequel) you see that there are defined good guys and bad guys in each one. The prequels was really Droids (Separatists) vs Republic (Clone Army), with Republic and Alien characters on both sides. This was definitely muddy since the battle lines didn&#8217;t get drawn until Episode 2, but when we explored this era in Legacy, we felt the need to carry out the main character types that we inherited from Decipher. Obviously, Original era is Rebels vs Imperials. We had a lot of discussion about whether we should make Resistance/First Order subtypes, since the undeniably come from Rebels and Imperials. We also debated the New Republic and the Republic icon in general. Ultimately I felt the distinct era deserved a distinct icon. I fully think that we would have seen that since Decipher created a new icon for their Ep1 sets instead of doing something like redefining Rebels to be all good guys and Imperials to be all bad guys, regardless of era. As of now, there are no plans for incorporating the New Republic in the game since we have no clue how effective it is, how much remains in play in universe, and frankly, since it didn&#8217;t affect the movie&#8217;s plot at all.

Now, an update is nothing without some teases, so here is some of my favorite game text in the set so far:

-Sorry about the Mess must target Greedo.  
-Once per game may /\ Force Freeze.  
-When deployed, may draw cards from Reserve Deck until you have at least 6 cards in hand.  
-During your control phase, if at a site you control, may steal one droid present.  
-Peek at the top card of your Reserve Deck; may exchange it with a card from hand with the same destiny number  
-If an ISB Agent on table, activate one force for each of your opponentâ€™s non-battlegrounds on table.  
-Once per turn, if in a senate majority or Stolen Data Tapes on table, may take your just drawn battle destiny into hand.  
-Once per game may play an interrupt from lost pile as if from hand (then place that card out of play).  
-If Graveyard of Giants on table, once per game place up to 3 cards randomly from your Lost Pile under 3 different Jakku sites as &#8216;wreckage&#8217;.  
-Once per game may \/ (or deploy from hand) an unpiloted starfighter here.  
-May add Poe (or any Spy) as a pilot and one gunner as passenger.  
-Adds 3 to the power of anything he is aboard as a passenger.
