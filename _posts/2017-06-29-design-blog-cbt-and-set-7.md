Greetings SWCCG Players!

You all are long overdue for an update from me on Set 7. By now I think you all know what is coming if you see a Design Blog pop up. That&#8217;s right, I am here to share not only news on Set 7, but the ENTIRE spoiler list as of today.

With the World Championships about 6 weeks away, we want to give all of the players as much time as possible to evaluate the impact of the new Set 7 cards on the meta. The feedback from playtesting and from the attendees at Nationals who saw some of the preview cards has been very positive, so we are excited to announce the upcoming release of Set 7. The PDF is expected to be available for download by July 12th, with the set being fully tournament legal on July 19th.

In conjunction with the release of Set 7, the Competitive Balance Team is also releasing a minor errata to Imperial Entanglements, which we believe will address the major impact that IE Troopers can have on the meta by setting up 8 damage on turn 2. It also will cause the non-trooper versions of IE to possibly rethink their first turn strategy and take a slightly more cautious approach.

> Imperial Entanglements (V) 0  
> Deploy Tatooine (with Devastator there) and a Tatooine battleground site.  
> For remainder of game, you may not deploy Sandwhirl, Jabba&#8217;s Palace sites, non-Imperial characters, non-Imperial starships, or systems.  
> While this side up, opponent loses no Force to Tatooine Occupation or your Force drains at Tatooine system. **You may not deploy Admiral&#8217;s Orders on your first turn.** Once per turn, may \/ a Tatooine battleground site.  
> Flip this card if you control three Tatooine sites and opponent controls fewer than three Tatooine sites.

While we&#8217;re on the topic of the Competitive Balance Team, I believe it is time I explain how this team functions now, and who the members are. The CBT is made up by the entire Design and Development teams and the Advocate Council. At this time, that is 16 people total. Any of these 16 CBT members can open discussion and voting on a card that they consider a problem, and propose a very specific solution in the poll. If 2/3 of the CBT members agree to the change, we begin the errata process (proofing and graphic design updates, as well as sometimes playtesting). With the current team at 16 members, that means 11 votes are required to go forward with a change. The above change to Imperial Entanglements was tested, tweaked, and now is at a balance that we like.

See below for the full current text on Set 7. Some of these are player cards, but most are from the Design team. As always is the case with spoilers, please remember that these are subject to change, whether that is from proofing or from development if a last minute balance concern is found. Please discuss what you think will be the biggest impact of Set 7 on the current meta!
