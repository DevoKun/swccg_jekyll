– Standard: a typical constructed-style format where each player uses their own 60 card decks (one Light Side and one Dark Side), created using any Decipher cards and/or Virtual Cards from the “standard Virtual Sets.” (No “legacy” Virtual Cards may be used.)  
– Legacy: a typical constructed-style format where each player uses their own 60 card decks (one Light Side and one Dark Side), created using any Decipher cards and/or Virtual Cards from the “legacy Virtual Sets.” (No “standard” Virtual Cards may be used.)  
– Sealed Deck: an event where players construct their decks immediately prior to the tournament after opening sealed packs and “drafting” cards out of those packs. Players do not need to bring any cards to these events, as they will build their deck from the sealed packs that are opened up prior to the tournament.  
– [Watto’s Chance Cube](http://71c.83c.myftpupload.com/tournaments/): a sealed deck-style event where players construct their decks immediately prior to the tournament after “drafting” them from a pre-determined card pool known as “the Cube.” So, instead of constructing a deck from randomized packs, the decks are constructed using familiar (and often times more useful) cards contained within the Cube. Players do not need to bring any cards to these events, as they will build their deck from the Cube brought by the Tournament Director.
