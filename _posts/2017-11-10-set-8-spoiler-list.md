**This is the complete spoiler list for set 8**.

Please note, as always any content is subject to change by release. Underlying cards are also subject to change, even though some are listed here. The graphic department is hard at work on finishing the missing pictures for the set. What I&#8217;ve seen so far looks great.

The items most likely to see change (or may even be cut) are Ralltiir (V), Jedha, Death Star: War Room (V), and Operational As Planned (V). Development is still discussing this after the recent playtest results have come in, but we think it&#8217;s good for the public to see them and comment on them too.

Releasing a spoiler list early is something we&#8217;ve done for the past couple of sets and it&#8217;s proven to be very helpful. Playtesters and D&D can only see so much, and having the entire community chime in at this point is a huge asset. Personal likes or dislikes are of course subjective, and usually not very helpful. We are rather looking for specific broken combos, playtest decks or missing protection on key strategy cards. Junkyard Falcon not being immune to Unsalvagable, Droids not being immune to certain cards in Diplo, and similar things were helpful suggestion in early stages of previous sets.

Without anything further&#8230; enjoy the spoilers of set 8 and let us know your thoughts&#8230;
