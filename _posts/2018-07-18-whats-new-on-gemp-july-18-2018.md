Greetings Online SWCCG players!

The GEMP development team just finished the first batch of Set 9 cards that are now live on GEMP for you to use:

  * Death Squadron Assignment
  * Xizor’s Palace: Sewer
  * Shadows Of The Empire
  * Kylo Ren With Lightsaber
  * Rey With Lightsaber
  * Rescue In The Clouds
  * A Brave Resistance
  * Rose

Thank you again for your continued patience during the transition period. The GEMP development team is continuing to make progress on the rest of Set 9, and I will update you all periodically as we add new cards!

MTFBWY,
