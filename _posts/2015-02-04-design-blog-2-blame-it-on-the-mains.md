Greetings, Star Wars players!

Since you all were so very appreciative of our last blog, let&#8217;s do it again!  Today, I want to share some of the mains that did (and did not) make it into Set 1.

Coming out of the Reset, there were a number of mains who did not make the cut for a variety of reasons.  One thing we wanted to do with part of our first set was to revisit some mains, who either didn&#8217;t have virtual versions or who we wanted to make cheap versions of for players to use.

Early on, our idea was to have a Yoda, an Emperor (or Sidious), a Lando, and a Boba Fett.  Those last two were chosen intentionally in order to help pull persona choices away from their Reflections 3 personas.  As it turns out, we got 1 of those 4 in the set.  The Yoda/Sidious/Emperor had some cool ideas, that played off the universal Sense from Yoda, Great Warrior, but we were gunshy about introducing more totally immune Jedi to the game just yet.  Boba Fett we had some neat ideas about, but never really got a direction of where we wanted to take him.  Lando, though, we like.  We hope you do too!

> •Lando Calrissian (V) 1  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Cloud City &#8211; R]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 3 ABILITY 3 FORCE-ATTUNED  
> Text: Smuggler. [Pilot] 2. Deploys -1 to Cloud City. When deployed, may /\ a character with “Cloud City” in lore. During battle, may use 1 Force to cancel the game text of a Dark Jedi (except Vader) at same site.  
> DEPLOY 3 FORFEIT 6  
> \[Pilot\]\[Warrior\]  
> Set Icon 1

Our Lando analogue became Tarkin, who was an ISB agent.  We found that ISB wanted to run Grand Moff Tarkin (V) instead.  Here&#8217;s what he looked like, before he got cut:

> •Tarkin (V) 1  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Jedi Pack &#8211; PM]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL  
> POWER 4 ABILITY 3 FORCE-ATTUNED  
> Text: [Pilot]2. When deployed, may take an ISB agent here into hand. Adds one battle destiny with an ISB agent. Opponent&#8217;s Force retrieval is -1 (to a minimum of 1).  
> DEPLOY 3 FORFEIT 7  
> [Pilot]  
> Set Icon 1

ISB instead got:

> •Corporal Vandolay (V) 2  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Dagobah &#8211; U]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL  
> POWER 2 ABILITY 2  
> Text: [Pilot]1. When deployed, may take an ISB agent here into hand. Once per turn, if you just drew an ISB agent for battle destiny, may take that card into hand to cancel and re-draw that destiny.  
> DEPLOY 2 FORFEIT 4  
> \[Warrior\] \[Pilot\]  
> Set Icon 1

We dreamed up a cool version of the Emperor that took some cues from the Legacy player card Shadows of the Empire.  He was in the set for a long time, but we recently pulled him since we wanted to flesh out what we wanted to do with AOBS more in a future set, and have him tested with those other potential cards.

> •The Emperor (V) 1  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Reflections II &#8211; P]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; IMPERIAL / DARK JEDI MASTER  
> POWER 4 ABILITY 7 DARK JEDI MASTER  
> Text: Never deploys or moves (even if carried) to a site opponent occupies. While on Coruscant, Scum And Villainy ignores Emperor. Once per turn, may subtract 1 (or 3 if with Xizor) from a just drawn weapon destiny at another location. Immune to attrition.  
> DEPLOY 5 FORFEIT 9  
> Set Icon 1

But a site he inspired still is in the set:

> •Coruscant: Imperial City (V)  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Special Edition &#8211; U]  
> LOCATION &#8211; SITE  
> DARK (1): Once per game, may \/ a character with &#8220;Black Sun&#8221; in lore here.  
> LIGHT (0): Your Force drains here are +1.  
> \[Exterior\]\[Planet\][Scomp Link]  
> Set Icon 1

As you can see, we are down 2 Dark Side mains!  And you&#8217;ll have to remain in the Dark (heh) about them for a little while longer.  They should come up in a future post.  Since the DS reveals haven&#8217;t been as sexy, here&#8217;s something for you all to chew on and see if you like:

> Imperial Entanglements [Ralltiir Operations (V)] 0  
> [Virtual Block 1 &#8211; Special Edition &#8211; R]  
> OBJECTIVE &#8211; FRONT  
> Text: Deploy Tatooine (with Devastator there) and a Tatooine battleground site.  
> For remainder of game, you may not deploy Sandwhirl, Jabba&#8217;s Palace sites, non-Imperial characters, non-Imperial starships, or systems. Once per turn, may \/ a Tatooine battleground site.  
> While this side up, opponent loses no Force to Tatooine Occupation or your Force drains at Tatooine system.  
> Flip this card if you control three Tatooine sites and opponent controls less than three Tatooine sites.  
> Set Icon 1●X  
> No One To Stop Us This Time [In The Hands Of The Empire (V)] 7  
> [Virtual Block 1 &#8211; Special Edition &#8211; R]  
> OBJECTIVE &#8211; BACK  
> Text: While this side up, once during your control phase, may peek at the top X cards of your Reserve Deck, where X = number of Tatooine locations you occupy; take one into hand and shuffle your Reserve Deck. Opponent&#8217;s characters require +1 Force to move from Tatooine sites using their landspeed. Once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one trooper.  
> Flip this card if opponent controls more Tatooine sites than you.  
> Set Icon 1●X

We are definitely still testing this out, but the largest functional change is that you don&#8217;t have call backs to Dewbacks or Local Trouble anymore, but you do get to pull sites on the 7 side and retrieve a trooper.  As it has been noted a bit, this was a pretty solid objective and we just wanted to get it back in the game and see what people can do with it in our new meta.

Back to mains- Light Side has one more, and that&#8217;s our friend Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He is a unique guy that can fit into a lot of LS decks, and brings back some of my favorite text on Ki-Adi-Mundi.

> •Obi-Wan Kenobi (V) 1  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Premiere &#8211; R1]  
> CHARACTER &#8211; REBEL  
> POWER 5 ABILITY 6 JEDI KNIGHT  
> Text: Obi-Wan&#8217;s deploy cost may not be increased. Power +1 for each Dark Jedi here. Once per game, may exchange two cards in hand with any one card in Lost Pile. Immune to attrition < 5.  
> DEPLOY 6 FORFEIT 9  
> [Warrior]  
> Set Icon 1
> 
> &nbsp;

A note: we had one spoiled card that changed since the last blog&#8230; guess which one???.

> •Green Leader In Green Squadron 1 [A-wing Cannon (V)] 2  
> [Virtual Set 1 – Death Star II – C]  
> STARFIGHTER – A-WING  
> POWER 5 MANEUVER 5 HYPERSPEED 4  
> Text: Permanent pilot is •Green Leader, who provides ability of 2. Adds one battle destiny with an A-wing, B-wing, X-wing or Y-wing. During battle, may cancel a starship’s immunity to attrition; this starship ‘hit.’  
> DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 4  
> \[Permanent Pilot\]\[Nav Computer\][Scomp Link]  
> Set Icon 1

We agreed that the stats on this guy were a little too good.  Dropping the forfeit makes his self sacrifice more painful (a 5 clears at least 2 cards now) and a destiny of 2 make him a little more reasonable.  Keep on discussing and helping us polish the release!
