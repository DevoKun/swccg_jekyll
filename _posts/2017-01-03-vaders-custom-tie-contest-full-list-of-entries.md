Happy New Year Star Wars Players!

So far, you&#8217;ve only seen 10 of the 66 entries submitted for the Vader&#8217;s Custom TIE contest. I am happy to finally be able to share the remaining entries with you for your reading pleasure.

Now is a great time to remind you that voting for the four finalists for the contest ends **Friday**, and the winner will be announced at the MPC on Saturday. If you haven&#8217;t voted yet, see the post here for details on how to vote (be sure to follow the instructions carefully!):

<http://www.starwarsccg.org/wp/vaders-custom-tie-contest-finalists/>

I&#8217;d like to give a huge shout out to everyone who submitted an entry. Without the overwhelming support for this, it would not have been as exciting as it was! I received lots of positive feedback on the contest in general, so expect more things like this in the future.
