Greetings, Star Wars players!

It might not seem like we don&#8217;t have a plan, but we are listening and we are tweaking cards based on your feedback.  I hope to reveal the entire list to you all soon, and to comment on what&#8217;s been changed since they were initially spoiled.

But first, we have to talk about WHAP.  When I asked for that &#8220;on deck&#8221; list to be created in the wake of the reset, one of the cards that seemed to garner a lot of interest was We&#8217;ll Take The Long Way, which radically redefined how the objective worked.  There was a lot of good discussion about how it was unthematic, and I and design team agreed and took it on ourselves to determine how we could make it work in a thematic way.

The first piece, which was teased last time was a new Hallway:

> •Naboo: Theed Palace Hallway (V)  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Theed Palace &#8211; U]  
> LOCATION: SITE  
> Light (1): Once per game, may /\ Ascension Guns. You may move here using landspeed for free.  
> Dark (0): While They Will Be Lost And Confused on table, this site gains [Dark Side].  
> \[Interior\]\[Planet\][Episode I]  
> Set Icon 1

As many of you suspected, this was a harbinger of making LS physically move into Theed Palace.  At the same time, we didn&#8217;t want to make it overly expensive and this sort of text fits other &#8220;Hallway&#8221; type sites in the game. On the DS text box, we felt it was important to keep LS relatively safe while getting ready to make their move, but we also wanted it to be a standard battleground mid-late game.  This sort of memory issue is not ideal, but since it has a strong physical tie (the objective flipping) we felt it solved the issues we were concerned with.

So how do you get into the Throne Room?  Well, you can walk, or all the cool kids use our new Ascensions Guns, just like in the MOOOOVIIEES.

> •Ascension Guns (V) 5  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Theed Palace &#8211; U]  
> USED INTERRUPT  
> Text: During your deploy phase, use X Force to relocate X of your characters at an interior Theed Palace site to Theed Palace: Throne Room. [Immune to Sense] OR If opponent occupies your location, peek at top two cards of your Reserve Deck and take one into hand.  
> Set Icon 1

This is a little more versatile than the legacy version, but still keeps the exact same &#8220;peek and keep&#8221; game text.  The idea is that you can move over during turn 2&#8217;s deploy phase in order to battle OR to flip, if the Throne Room is uncontested.

The final piece of the puzzle, is our completely redone We&#8217;ll Take The Long Way:

> •We&#8217;ll Take The Long Way [•Security Control (V)] 4  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Coruscant &#8211; U]  
> EFFECT  
> Text: If We Have A Plan on table, deploy on table. Imperials deploy +1 to Theed Palace Throne Room and, while you occupy that site, you may ignore your objective’s location deployment restrictions. Once per game, may /\ an [Episode I] system and/or a [Theed Palace] leader. [Immune to Alter.]  
> [Episode I]  
> Set Icon 1

First, the name of this went back and forth a lot, and as of now we are leaning towards this mainly so if people have signed copies from Legacy they can still use them.  It&#8217;s drastically different from that version, so I see the argument for a whole new name.  Let us know what you think!

Onto the card &#8211; we wanted to make it so a Hunt Down couldn&#8217;t get turn 1 Vader to the Throne Room, and since we are making it harder to get there, we wanted to let LS reinforce if they are facing a multi turn battle to win the site.  This also has the neat side effect of letting you use Guns to get to the TR, and then deploying some help before battling on your turn 2.

The biggest change is the idea that we are guaranteeing you Amidala.  So much of WHAP was built to find Amidala, and we found in testing that if you couldn&#8217;t find her, no matter the build, WHAP failed miserably.  Originally we just had the system pull to try and help give WHAP some more activation and the ability to play space if they chose, but testing repeatedly asked for an Amidala pull and it worked out well thus far.  I liken it to the OPG pull of Watto on the Junkyard.

Finally, testing of late has suggested that we put the Theed Palace related text on the site itself- a new Theed Palace Throne Room (V).  I think that could work, but I didn&#8217;t really like the idea of leaving the possibility of it being converted since it&#8217;s such key text.  I felt it was close enough to Despair (V) to warrant keeping it on an Effect.  What do you think????

======================================================

We hope that you enjoy this new, more thematic take on WHAP!

And for your DS fans, we didn&#8217;t want to leave you in the lurch.  If you remember, I promised that we had two secret DS Mains.  And now we are ready to show them off:

> Jango Fett (V) 1  
> Lore: Trade Federation bounty hunter and scout.  
> CHARACTER &#8211; ALIEN  
> POWER 4 ABILITY 3 ARMOR 5  
> Adds 2 to the power and 1 to maneuver of anything he pilots. Adds one battle destiny if with opponent&#8217;s Jedi, [Permanent Weapon] or [Maintenance] card. May be targeted by Hidden Weapons. If about to be lost, may /\ Boba Fett.  
> DEPLOY 4 FORFEIT 6  
> \[Pilot\]\[Warrior\][Episode I]  
> Set Icon 1
> 
> Slave I, Symbol Of Fear [Slave I (V)] 3  
> [Virtual Set 1 &#8211; Cloud City &#8211; R]  
> STARFIGHTER: FIRESPRAY-CLASS ATTACK SHIP  
> POWER 3 MANEUVER 5 HYPERSPEED 5  
> Text: May add 2 non-[Maintenance] pilots and 2 passengers. Power +1 for each opponent’s starship here. While Jango or Boba Fett piloting, immune to attrition < 5.  
> DEPLOY 3 FORFEIT 5  
> \[Scomp Link\]\[Nav Computer\]\[Independent\]\[Episode I\]
