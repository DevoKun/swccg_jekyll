Greetings, Star Wars Players!

If you&#8217;ve been following this space, you know that last time I announced that we were going to start a trial period of public playtesting for Set 2, the first all player card set.  It begins today!  If you are interested in participating, join us here:

<http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=899>

There has been a lot of good discussion on the boards about how you can test, and in lieu of generating content myself I&#8217;m going to promote some of the best points.

From Cole Lepine:

> Having read a lot of reports, things that I find really important to specify:
> 
> 1. Decklists  
> 2. The first two or three turns, mentioning places where variability came into play (or not, as the case may be).  
> 3. General impressions.  
> 4. Key card interactions, especially ones that are not obvious and are strong/broken/interesting.
> 
> There are a few questions I consider when evaluating a card:
> 
> 1. What do I gain from playing this card?  
> 2. How can my opponent play around this card without making any changes to their deck?  
> 3. How strong an effect does the card give? Do I expect it to cause my opponents to &#8220;meta&#8221; against it? What happens if they do?
> 
> one piece of advice to people looking at public testing.

And from Mark VanDriel:

> An absolutely valid (and necessary) part of playtesting is setting up the scenario to playtest. If you are testing a splashable dude or interrupt, there is not much of point to playtesting 15 games, in none of which the card sees play. It is exceptionally useful to set up the scenario. One example of this is forcing the card into your starting hand. Using simulated games to set up the scenario you want to test is perfectly valid and useful for playtesters to do. HOWEVER, it is critical that you are completely honest about how you set up the situation. This honesty allows the developers to better understand the context of your report.
> 
> Also, sometimes PTing reports need not rely on thing which explicitly happen. A great example of this is for Droidika (v) from V1. You could mix a few of these into a regular destroyer droid deck and test them to see how powerful they are (which is good!). But it is also probably useful to keep track of how often having the mixture avoided vulnerability to grimtaash, and how often the bonus force from their draws was critical in your turns resource management. Sometimes game reports include wonderful details but forget to incorporate the things that didn&#8217;t happen in a game because of the pt-ing cards.

The cards are out there, so start thinking them over, especially those of you who can&#8217;t make upcoming events.  It would be great to have testing from you guys as those of us event prepping can&#8217;t devote a ton of time to it for a while.
