Hi everyone,

I’m writing this article on Halloween, and appropriately, it’s the 13<sup>th</sup> NARP Fortnightly. So this fortnight, I’ll get thematic by talking about a “spooky” group of characters: Dark Side aliens.

Plenty of decks can make room for a [Dengar With Blaster Carbine (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/dengarwithblastercarbine.gif), a [Dr. Evazan & Ponda Baba](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/drevazan&pondababa.gif), or a [Mara Jade With Lightsaber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/marajadewithlightsaber.gif), but maybe that’s not enough aliens for you. If you want your deck to look more like a monster movie, then you probably want to take a look at one of these objectives:

[Carbon Chamber Testing/My Favorite Decoration](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/carbonchambertesting.gif)  
[Court Of The Vile Gangster/I Shall Enjoy Watching You Die](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/courtofthevilegangster.gif)  
[My Kind Of Scum/Fearless And Inventive](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/mykindofscum.gif)  
[Agents Of Black Sun/Vengeance Of The Dark Prince](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/agentsofblacksun.gif)

All of these have their own strengths and weaknesses, and there are other options too (like a [Combat Readiness (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/combatreadiness.gif) start with [Jabba’s Palace](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/tatooinejabbaspalace.gif)). To build an alien deck with the first three, you’re usually going to use [Scum And Villainy](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/scumandvillainy.gif) (pulled by [Jabba The Hutt (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/jabbathehutt.gif), who is pulled by the [Audience Chamber](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/jabbaspalaceaudiencechamber.gif)). AOBS usually doesn’t play that effect, but the objective limits you to mostly aliens. (You do get the Emperor.) For now, though we’re just going to talk about characters.

**The Droid Package**** **

Okay, I’m starting out by talking about characters other than aliens, but I’m listing them first because they are absolutely mandatory for alien decks and cannot be skipped no matter what. This is because of [Leia, Rebel Princess](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Light/leiarebelprincess.gif); you need to have several non-alien characters to reduce her impact.

_Auto-plays:_

[P-59](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/p59.gif)  
[Probot](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/probot.gif)  
4-LOM With Concussion Rifle (usually [non-V](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/4lomwithconcussionrifle.gif) in these decks, but [V](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/4lomwithconcussionrifle.gif) is good too)  
[IG-88 (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/ig88.gif) (in CCT)  
[Guri](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/guri.gif) (in AOBS)

_Good plays:_

Guri (in non-AOBS decks)  
[IG-88 With Riot Gun](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/ig88withriotgun.gif) (in non-CCT decks)  
[P-60](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/p60.gif)  
[Daroe (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set2-Dark/daroe.gif) (not a droid, but pulls one)

**The Bounty Hunter Package**

This is most of the character pool available to you in AOBS, and it’s also potent in Court, as they all get forfeit +2. If you want to really emphasize this package, you want at least 10 bounty hunters. (I’ve built decks with as many as 14.) Remember that 4-LOM and IG-88 count too. (See above.)

_Auto-plays:_

[Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/bobafettbountyhunter.gif) (at least 2 copies)  
[Cad Bane](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Dark/cadbane.gif)  
Dengar With Blaster Carbine (V)  
[Greedo (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/greedo.gif)  
[Jango Fett](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/jangofett.gif)  
[Bossk (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/bossk.gif) (if the smuggler package is also used)  
[Jodo Kast](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/jodokast.gif) (if Hidden Weapons is used)

_Good plays:_

[Zam Wesell](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/zamwesell.gif)  
[Djas Puhr (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/djaspuhr.gif)  
[Aurra Sing](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Tatooine-Dark/aurrasing.gif)  
[Bane Malar](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/banemalar.gif)  
[Ree-Yees](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/reeyees.gif) (if the smuggler package is also used)  
[Snoova](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/snoova.gif) (if the smuggler package is also used)

**The Smuggler Package**** **

This group revolves around a few combos: [Elis In Hinthra](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/elisinhinthra.gif), which pulls a smuggler, [Ponda Baba (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/pondababa.gif), who piles on attrition when with another smuggler, Bossk (V), who gets a power bonus with a smuggler, and Snoova, who gets a deploy bonus. To take advantage of these guys, you want around 4 of them (maybe 5).

_Auto-plays:_

Ponda Baba (V)  
[Dr. Evazan](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premiere-Dark/drevazan.gif)  
[Wooof (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Dark/wooof.gif)

_Good plays:_

[Yade M’rak](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/yademrak.gif)  
[Banniss Keeg, Pilot Instructor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set3-Dark/banisskeegpilotinstructor.gif)  
Ree-Yees (if the bounty hunter package is also used)

**The “R’tic H’weei Beatdown” Package**** **

[R’tic Hweei](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Dark/rtichweei.gif) is a powerful character that can use your opponent’s Force. This is usually combined with [Broken Concentration](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Dagobah-Dark/brokenconcentration.gif) (to use even more of their Force) and [First Strike](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/firststrike.gif) (to prevent them from playing interrupts like [Dodge](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Light/dodge.gif) and [Houjix](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ANewHope-Light/houjix.gif) once you use up their whole Force pile). To take advantage of this, you want the highest power you can get, for the lowest deploy cost, to maximize your chances of causing a lot of battle damage.

_Auto-plays:_

R’tic Hweei  
Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter  
Bossk (V)  
Snoova  
Dr. Evazan & Ponda Baba

**The Power Of The Hutt/Sail Barge Package**** **

Any deck with Scum And Villainy should be playing Jabba The Hutt (V) to pull it, but if you start [Power Of The Hutt](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Premium-Dark/powerofthehutt.gif), you can use some other tricks to protect the Audience Chamber and battle with [Jabba’s Sail Barge (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set4-Dark/jabbassailbarge.gif). Alien leaders are seen in this package, for protecting Jabba. The Barge is seen most often in My Kind Of Scum, as it deploys multiple exterior Tatooine sites.

_Auto-plays:_

[Bib Fortuna](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/bibfortuna.gif) (Reflections III version)  
[Ephant Mon](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/ephantmon.gif)

_Good plays:_

[Boelo](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/SpecialEdition-Dark/boelo.gif)  
[Pote Snitkin (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set2-Dark/potesnitkin.gif)  
[Prince Xizor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsII-Dark/princexizor.gif)  
[Chokk](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Coruscant-Dark/chokk.gif)  
[Thok & Thug](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/ReflectionsIII-Dark/thok&thug.gif)

There are more packages than just these, but these lists are a pretty good starting point.

**Card of the Fortnight**

Continuing with the alien theme, let’s talk about an interrupt that’s nearly 20 years old but still sees a lot of play in competitive decks:

[Hidden Weapons](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Dark/hiddenweapons.gif)

The power of this card is pretty easy to understand. It can make an opponent’s character—_any_ character, even Mace Windu or Qui-Gon Jinn—immediately captured, hit, or lost. This is a godsend to alien decks, which need extra tricks (and treats!) to keep powerful Jedi off the table. It gets around counter cards like [Blaster Deflection](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/JabbasPalace-Light/blasterdeflection.gif), Dodge, and [Jerus Jannick](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/TheedPalace-Light/jerusjannick.gif), and doesn’t care about the target’s defense value at all.

The [Mandalorian Armor](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/CloudCity-Dark/mandalorianarmor.gif) device is rarely played. Instead, Hidden Weapons is usually used with Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter, Jango Fett, or Jodo Kast. For added fun, pair one of those characters with Dr. Evazan (or combo) so that any draw of 4 or higher can make the target immediately lost.

However, watch out for [Hear Me Baby, Hold Together (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set1-Light/hearmebabyholdtogether.gif). That card can ruin your day, which makes it a good grabber candidate. [Put That Down (V)](http://www.starwarsccg.org/cardlist-beta/img/Set0-Light/putthatdown.gif) can also lessen the impact.

That’s it for this fortnight. Until next time…

Peace, Love, and High Destinies,
