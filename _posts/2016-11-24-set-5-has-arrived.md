The Players Committee is happy to announce the release of Set 5 two days earlier than scheduled! The pdf is available for download [here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/virtual/Set-5.pdf) and is legal for tournament play Friday, December 2nd. Nearly all of the cards in the set are player created cards.

Big thank you to the graphics team and the proofing team for working around the clock to get this released in time for you to enjoy it before the Thanksgiving holiday (just in case you need a break from football and turkey)!
