We had 8 players to start the tournament, which is a great turnout. It was a mixture of veterans and new/returning players. We got underway a little after 12PM.

Game 1: My QMC vs Zach&#8217;s DS Combat  
I decided to give QMC another try after seeing how successful it was at Worlds and after acquiring a H1 package. Zach sets up Sidious and Maul on Naboo and starts to drain. I set up my guys on CC and start my drains. At some point Celebration is played along with Ultimatum, keeping his damage to 4/turn while I retrieved 2. Once Pucumir hit the table it was pretty much over. Pretty standard non-interactive Combat/QMC game.  
Win

Game 2: My ISB vs Quentin&#8217;s Hyperdrive  
I had only seen Hyperdrive played once so I only knew the basic concept of it- set up on Tatooine and drain cards into No Parts, No Deal. I am running the Executor/Finalizer version in this game. A couple of turns in I realize that I had forgotten to put a Cmd Merrijk into my deck! Luckily I had open handed Bespin but Jakku was trapped in my reserve deck for the time being. Instead I set up my free Executor at Bespin and put the Finalizer to Quentin&#8217;s Naboo. My ISB agents all went to my generic docking bay deployed to Tatooine to lower the LS force drains. We trade trains back and forth for a few turns, eventually my damage was up to 9/turn and Quentin&#8217;s at 5/6. I ended up winning the damage race just before he could get enough guys to come over and contest my docking bay.  
Win

After game 2 some of the guys had to head out due to personal obligations.  
Game 3: My QMC vs Adam&#8217;s Invasion  
I had played several iterations of Adam&#8217;s Invasion deck so I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be an easy game. We start and he flips fairly quickly, but stays on Naboo. I manage to flip turn 2/3 and stack my guys at the guest quarters. Pucumir and Deneb Both were out early to deal with Tey How canceling my system drains at Bespin. With Celebration out and a well-timed We&#8217;re Doomed the game was tilting in my favor. However Adam decided to invade CC with some droids and took out a couple of my guys with 2 destiny draws of 6. Ouch. Not wanting to tempt fate again I decided to play hide and seek with the rest of my scrubs, getting in drains where I could. But he was catching up quickly. I managed to get in a total drain of 5 of his remaining 6 life force but it was too late. He won the game and title the next turn&#8230; BY ONE CARD.![:explode](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/images/smilies/gonnablow.gif "explode") : Well fought, Adam. We were both mentally exhausted at this point- I forgot to even take a picture of him with his custom OTSD box cover (Thanks Dan!).

At this point the remaining players also ran out of time, so we capped the games at 3. Still though, an awesome turnout for this event. Thanks to everyone for coming and I hope you had fun. Thanks to the PC for the sweet AI slips! Also thanks to the District Company for hosting us once again. If anyone is ever visiting Eau Claire I would highly recommend you check out their new location. It&#8217;s fantastic!
