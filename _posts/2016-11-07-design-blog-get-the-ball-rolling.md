In many ways, the fall is busiest SWCCG tournament season of the year. Post-Worlds excitement has winded down, but large contingencies traveled for Euros and Texas Mini-Worlds, and this weekend is the 3rd Annual Local Tournament Weekend.

I (along with the design, development, and playtesting teams) have been hard at work behind the scenes planning the future of our game, and for a time there I was just designing, developing, and playtesting cards, some of which may never be released. Meanwhile, I have followed the majors that have happened in the past two months, and saw all of the exciting new ideas players are still coming up with, without the aid of unreleased cards. The meta is clearly still adapting, and players are using their creativity to introduce new wrinkles. The players who play the most and practice the most are rewarded.

That brings me to this weekend, where I found the time to play some more games in the current meta for the first time since Worlds as I prepared for Local Tournament Weekend. I updated some of my own decks, built my favorite decks from Europeans and Texas Mini Worlds, and my brother and I got a few games in.

And now I&#8217;ve caught the bug once again. For me, the longer I keep my cards in the closet, the easier it is to leave them there. But once I start tweaking decks and playing games, the wheels start turning and I can&#8217;t put them down.

If you&#8217;re like this too, now is a great time to just go make some decks. The meta is great, Local Tournament Weekend is less than a week away, the MPC is around the corner, and a new set is due out within about a month. I strongly encourage you to get out this weekend and support your local gaming store. Even if you don&#8217;t have a sanctioned LTW event, play some games anyway. Then when you catch the bug too, **register for the MPC** if you haven&#8217;t already. It&#8217;s my favorite event of the year, and if you&#8217;ve been to the MPC before, you know why. If you haven&#8217;t, you have to give it a shot. The bracket anticipation and matchup prep add a different flair from other events, and the event is always run smoothly. Even if you have a short stint in the main bracket, the consolation event is top notch as well.

This is the part of the design blog where I would normally share a spoiler with you. But alas, that is above my pay grade. Because this set is almost exclusively player cards, the player creators are given the privilege of spoiling the cards once they are finalized. A few of them have permission, but are waiting for the right time to spoil them, so keep your eyes peeled for spoilers in the near future!

I will say one thing about a recent rules update that hinted at a Black Squadron starship for Light Side. Darth Vader (V) was given an errata to only function with _your_ Black squadron pilot, leading many to believe Poe Dameron would be getting his matching X-wing in this set. While we did have plans to release Black One this set, it did not make the final cut. It will be released eventually, but we decided that it didn&#8217;t serve a direct purpose in the meta at the moment, since Poe already has a matching ship in the stolen TIE fighter, and he is often played without Squadron Assignments anyway. But there will be a Black One sighting in the future, just not in Set 5.

Enjoy your locals this weekend SWCCG players! I look forward to all of the tournament reports and hope you all see some new players in your area. Then, I look forward to seeing you and those new players at the MPC in January!

May The Force Be With You,
