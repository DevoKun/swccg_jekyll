**The PC Forums**  
Most SWCCG players’ primary interface with the game is via the message boards on this website. Known as <a title="the PC Vorums" href="http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PC Forums</a> (or simply “the forums” or “the boards”), they date back to the earliest days of the Players’ Committee in 2002 and have been incredibly active ever since. Slowly, the forums overtook DeckTech, the GamePlayersNetwork, and other websites to become the primary online mecca for interaction between fans of SWCCG.

**Holotable**  
The easiest way for new and returning players to jump into the game is by playing online. The Holotable program, available at [www.holotable.com](http://www.holotable.com/) is an incredible resource which lets you build decks and play games instantly against other players all over the world. The program is free and gives you access to every card you could want. The interface can have a bit of a learning curve, but once you’ve gotten the hang of it, it’s almost like being able to sit down across from a live opponent.

**Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch)**  
The PC maintains a presence on all mainstream social media platforms. “Like” us on <a title="Facebook - SWCCG" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/SWCCG/110583678963318?ref=br_tf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a title="Twitter - SWCCG" href="https://twitter.com/swccg‎" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> to be kept abreast of all major SWCCG news.
