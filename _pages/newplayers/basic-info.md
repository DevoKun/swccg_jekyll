_Star Wars CCG_ was first released in December 1995 after game play rights were purchased from a game designer. Over the years, Decipher added 11 full expansions to the original card base, as well as numerous smaller expansions, special purpose sets, and promotional releases. The last set, Theed Palace, was offered in the fall of 2001. The game spanned all of the classic Star Wars trilogy (_[A New Hope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope")_, _[The Empire Strikes Back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back "Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back")_, and _[Return of the Jedi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi "Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi")_) as well as _[The Phantom Menace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace")_. During several years of the game&#8217;s run, between 1995 and 1998, it was a top-selling CCG, second only to _[Magic: The Gathering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering "Magic: The Gathering")_ and occasionally surpassing _Magic_, according to both [InQuest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InQuest "InQuest") and [Scrye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrye "Scrye") [magazines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine "Magazine").

At the end of 2001, after much negotiation, [Lucasfilm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm "Lucasfilm") chose not to renew Decipher&#8217;s license to use the Star Wars intellectual property. The license was granted to[Wizards of the Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_the_Coast "Wizards of the Coast"), which used it to create their own game, the _[Star Wars Trading Card Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Trading_Card_Game "Star Wars Trading Card Game")_. Decipher can no longer legally create new expansions to SWCCG; many cards that were in development can never be released to the public.

As of 2013, SWCCG still has an active playing community. The game is administered by a Players&#8217; Committee, which interprets rules, organizes tournaments, and releases &#8220;virtual expansions&#8221; which give alternate game text for existing cards. The new &#8220;virtual cards&#8221; function as entirely new cards and keep the game environment constantly evolving. The &#8220;virtual card&#8221; overlays are available for free on the Players&#8217; Committee website, though players must have the original card to use its &#8220;virtual&#8221; version. To date, the Players&#8217; Committee has produced 8 blocks of virtual sets (over 20 total sets).
