Holotable is an online program custom-built Star Wars ccg &#8220;card table&#8221; that allows you to play games against other players. It has a centralized server with a lobby that allows you to find interested opponents. Basic instructions are available <a href="http://starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=332&t=17383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. If you have problems figuring out or using Holotable, you can ask questions <a href="http://starwarsccg.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Holotable also has a deck-building program Holodeck, which can be extremely useful for building and organizing decks, as it keeps updated accurate text and images.

SWIP is a powerful deckbuilding program for Star Wars CCG. It is much more powerful of an engine than holodeck, but the files it creates are not compatible with holotable or any form of online play. It features sophisticated search abilities, and details on what cards any particular card is pulled by or pulls.

TheÂ SW-IP Database has been updated to remove cards that were removed from the game with the Reset and is now up to date with cards through Set 6. Find the most [current update here](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=188&t=57098&p=1113196#p1113196).

Vkit is a program that compiles the specific virtual slips that you want to print off (in the quantity you desire) from the official star wars ccg pc .pdf releases. The quality is generally a little inferior to using the official documents, but it can save a significant amount of paper, and conveniently allows you to print all the v-slips for any particular deck. The desktop client is easy to use. Please note that the original online version developed by Lee Edwards is no longer functional or available.
