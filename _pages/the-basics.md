The cards in the game consist of many different card types. Each card type (with the exception of Locations) can be distinguished by an icon in the upper left hand corner of the card. Below is an outline of the basic card types:

**Locations**  
Locations are where the action happens. Most locations represent either a place on the ground (a “site”) or the area in orbit around a planet (a “system”). Locations are where characters and ship will deploy, battle, and move. There is also a 3rd type of location, known as a “sector” but most basic decks will not includes sectors.

**Characters**  
Characters are fairly straightforward. These are the people who make up the core of the Star Wars universe, as well as the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Characters deploy from your hand to locations on the table and can move from place to place, interact, and battle with each other. Characters can only exist where there is atmosphere, hence they may only deploy to sites, or aboard starships at a system. A character cannot deploy directly to a system without the use of a starship (they would be floating in space).

**Starships**  
Starships deploy to systems and allow characters to deploy aboard them.

**Vehicles**  
Vehicles are similar to starships but deploy mostly to sites instead of systems and are used on the ground.

**Weapons**  
A Weapon is a card that usually deploys on a character, vehicle, or starship and augments that card’s abilities in battle. It is entirely possible to have a battle without weapons, but weapons are a good way to allow your forces an extra advantage in battle.

**Devices**  
Devices are similar to weapons in that they deploy on other cards and augment those cards’ abilities, but instead of augmenting their abilities in battle, Devices generally augment a card’s abilities outside of battle.

**Effects**  
An Effect is a card that deploys on the table and causes some type of change in the game state which continues as long as the Effect remains on the table.

**Interrupts**  
Similar to an Effect, but with some key differences. While an Effect only deploys during its owner’s Deploy Phase, an Interrupt may be played at any time, on either players’ turn. However, the interrupt does not remain on the table. It merely resolves itself and is then placed in either its owner’s Used Pile or Lost Pile, depending on the type of Interrupt.

**Objectives**  
Objectives are powerful cards around which one can base an advanced deck. Decks can only include a maximum of 1 objective card and that objective starts the game on the table and will be the focus of your deck. Objectives are double sided cards. The front side of an objective will generally contain text allowing you to setup your deck in a particular way and proving you with a goal that you must achieve. Upon completion of this goal you will be allowed to “flip” your objective and the backside of the objective card will give you a number of bonuses as a reward for flipping your objective.[/toggle]

[toggle title=&#8221;Phases&#8221; open=&#8221;no&#8221;]  
Each turn is divided into six phases:

**1.  Activate**  
In the Activate phase, the player whose turn it is gets to move cards from his Reserve Deck to his Force Pile, and these cards can be used later on to pay costs, or be drawn into his hand. The amount of cards a player is allowed to move in this phase is equal to 1 + the number of Force Icons that that player has on the table.

**2. Control**  
In the Control phase, if the player whose turn it is “controls” any locations (has a total ability of 1 or more at the location and his opponent does not) that player can make his opponent lose Force equal to the number of his opponent’s Force Icons at that location.

**3. Deploy**  
The Deploy phase is where the player whose turn it is can play cards from their hand to the table. The player can play as many cards from their hand as they like, as long as they have enough cards in their Force Pile to pay for all of the deployments.

**4. Battle**  
If both players have a total ability of 1 or greater at the same location, the player whose turn it is can initiate battles at any or all of those locations in the Battle phase.

**5. Move**  
The player whose turn it is may move any or all of his characters, vehicles, or starships from one location to another during the Move phase.

**6.  Draw**  
The player whose turn it is may choose to draw any number of cards remaining in his Force Pile into his hand. Any cards not drawn remain in the Force Pile to be saved and used later on. At the conclusion of the draw phase, any cards that have been placed into a player’s Used Pile are “recirculated” and placed back underneath that player’s Reserve Deck. Both players (regardless of whose turn it is) recirculate at the end of every turn. Recirculation concludes a turn and the opponent may then begin his next turn.[/toggle]
