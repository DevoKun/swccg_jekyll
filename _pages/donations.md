# Donations 

## 

The Advocate Council and Marketing Team would like to announce the new 2018/2019 donation tier rewards. This year’s program will “go live” as of November, and will run until the end of 2019. The system has different “Tiers” of donation amounts, and each Tier will have different rewards that you will receive when you donate that much money, similar to a Kickstart campaign but ongoing all season.The donation system is set up on a yearly basis, and each year rewards packages will be sent out to anyone who donated up to a certain donation amount. As opposed to previous years we will have donation prize packages ready in early 2019 and will start shipping them out as soon as we get donations (or combine it with shop order deliveries, etc.). If you want to continue donating in multiple intervals, then please note so on your donation by writing “multiple donations” behind your name. Otherwise we will send you the tier package for which you donated).The exclusive items (AI, foil slips, t-shirt image, etc) will change by year. 2018/2019 will have one design for each of these, then will change for the following year’s (2020) packages, etc. Note that some of the higher tiers have a limit to how many can be rewarded. We will do our best to keep these quantities updated at all times. We will be able to facilitate giving a charitable contribution receipt at the end of the year, as well (if required, please contact us at the time to let us know).And as always we’d like to extend a big thank you in advance for your support of the PC. Your gracious gifts will help keep our organization running for many years.
