  <p>
    The Star Wars Customizable Card Game was first released in December, 1995 by a company called Decipher, Inc. Over the next six years, the game’s following grew, and with a player base of over 40,000 strong, it became the second most popular trading card game in the world, after Magic: The Gathering. Decipher released 11 full expansion sets for the game, as well as a number of smaller sets. However, in December, 2001, Decipher announced that it had been unable to extend its license with Lucasfilm, Ltd. to produce the game.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unable to continue to produce, market, or support the game, Decipher instead created a volunteer committee of some of the game’s most active and accomplished players. They christened this group the Star Wars Customizable Card Game: Players Committee. The Players Committee, or PC as it is better known, was given control of the oversight of the game, including the championship tournament season, and was also afforded the ability to create new cards for the game, although with a number of restrictions. Chief among them, was that the cards could only be distributed electronically. The PC could not create physical cards. Additionally, the PC could not utilize new images from the Star Wars films. Finally, everything the PC created must be distributed for free. No PC cards could be sold.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What resulted became known as the “Virtual Cards.” These Virtual Cards (or V-cards) can be <a href="http://www.starwarsccg.org/resources/virtual-slips/">downloaded for free here</a> and have allowed the game to continue under the PC’s watch for over twice as long as Decipher actually produced the game.

    The Players Committee maintained the competitive scene by organizing local, state, regional, and world tournaments. With the cooperation of Decipher and Lucasfilm Ltd., the Player’s Committee also began releasing new cards to the playing community in 2002. These new cards came in the form of new game text boxes and eventually new card names and entire frames that could be printed out and placed over existing cards, giving that card a new name and new capabilities. Since 2001, the Player’s Committee has continued to guide the Star Wars: CCG to great success, releasing multiple expansion sets a year and maintaining a vibrant competitive scene with a loyal playing community.

    <strong>Charitable Donations</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although originally printed as a for-profit venture by a business, the Star Wars CCG community, under the leadership of the Players Committee, has now turned the game into a friendly, open and welcoming group designed at fostering relationships and growing the game and Star Wars lore. Without the goal of selling the newer cards in mind, the Players Committee is able to develop the game with the players and playing community in mind.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Due to this evolving sense of community as a priority, Players Committee has even been incorporated as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, with the goal of continuing the history, passion, and friendly nature of the Star Wars Customizable Card game. (You can donate to the cause <a href="http://www.starwarsccg.org/donations/">here</a>). Players from around the world frequently gather together to play one another and share their stories and experiences, while interacting with new people and making new friends over their common bond of Star Wars and Star Wars cards. In fact, in Minnesota, there is even a middle school program designed by Mark Walseth, an 8th grade social studies teacher, who uses the Star Wars CCG as a great way to teach his students game theory, math, critical (and creative) thinking, sportsmanship, fair play, and a sense of community – all lessons that extend beyond a simple card game. And this is all achieved by two people sitting across from one another playing a game about characters and scenes we are all familiar with and can relate to.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here at Rosemount Middle School (MN), we have a block of time (23 minutes) in the middle of the day in-between lunch and homeroom. During this time teachers are allowed to create activities for students to participate in. These sessions last for roughly 6 weeks, at which point new sessions are made available. Students for the most part select which one they want to be in with quite a few exceptions. My SWCCG session is one of those exceptions. I usually wait until the 2nd (Late October) or 3rd session (Early December) to run the SWCCG session. The reasoning is that it gives me a chance to get to know the students first. This is an important step because all of the students who participate are hand selected by me. Students I select must fall into one or more of the following criteria: 1) have an interest in Star Wars 2) have demonstrated a high academic standard 3) have demonstrated a passion for creativity 4) have shown difficulties in relating to peers (or simply introverted) or 5) may seem to need positive goal to work towards. The number of students who participate in the session each year range between 15 – 30.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    During the daily 23 minute session they learn the basic 7 Phases (ie, Activate, Control, Deploy, Battle, Move, Draw, Recycle) they also learn simple card etiquette and genre. Students start out with a simple preview of what exactly SWCCG is, meaning the community itself, what they have to look forward to, and possible goals. We also do a little self-analysis and whether or not this may be a good fit. In the days that follow they are required to take notes and have tasks to complete at home as well. During this period they start out with 10 cards, to practice the 7 phases, and this expands to 20, and eventually 30, based on completion of tasks. The last 2 weeks of the session students are allowed to apply and practice what they’ve learned.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At the end of the 6 weeks, all players are then invited to join an after school session. Out of the roughly 20 students who were taught the basics, usually 10 – 15 will sign up for the after school activity. At first these sessions are only made available to 8th graders who are taught more advanced components of the game (objectives, defensive shields, starting interrupts, virtual cards, other electronic resources and communities, etc.). Students are still required to complete homework and asked to be prepared for discussion questions. After a given time, the after school sessions are then exposed to former students (High School and older). This is an exciting time for everyone, both new and veteran. Veterans are encouraged to help and support new players. All members are consistently reminded we are all on the same team, we all came from the same starting place, and we’ve all been through the same learning system. As the school year proceeds students are paired up to play 1 game a day. At the end of the school year we hold the Rosemount Championship (RMC). This tournament is only for current and former players, and is carries much weight with the community. The players fully understand they are playing for the title of “Best Rosemount Player.” In 2014, we hit an all time high attendance of 37 players.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once the students move on from the middle school they are now part of the veteran community. From the roughly 12 that participated as an 8th grader, 3 – 5 will usually continue to participate as a High Schooler.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Where the cards have come from over the years is difficult to say. If I had to ball park a guess I would say something like 40% my contribution (purchases I’ve made over the years) 40% from the donations of Nick Kolnick (a former Advocate and devoted Star Wars CCG player, who donated his entire collection to this school-run activity) and 20% the Players Committee and other players who have heard about the program. The amount of time it takes to organize, plan, create activities, teaching tools, one on one explanation during game play, and tournaments is immeasurable. <em>I’d also like to point out that without the time and effort put in by the veteran players (post 8th grade) this program would not be possible. </em>For example today, 7 of them are coming to the middle school to help me put together starting sets for the midday session. This will take a few hours, and would be not possible without their help. It takes so much time to put 25 sets together. Each set contains 30 cards. Each set is made of the same 30 cards. Trying to find, and organize this is extremely monotonous and labor intensive. Again, not possible without their help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We currently have a Facebook page with 72 members (about 50% of them are still active and play) who have all gone through the Rosemount system.

    I’ve done this now for 16 years, and I can tell you for some of them this opportunity has been very valuable. I’ve received many praises from parents who were super excited to see their student have the opportunity to participate in a social after school activity. Young teenagers are at a very interesting time in their life when things can seem confusing or strange. The Rosemount SWCCG Community has provided many students with the opportunity to create lasting relationships and a sense of belonging. In fact, there are still at least two students that participated in my first year and are still a major part of it 16 years later.
