# Cube 

Watto’s Chance Cube is a way to simulate sealed deck play, but with more familiar and powerful cards than a typical sealed deck experience would offer. The same set of cards are used to compromise the draft pool and players also receive a set of 10 “fixed” cards to ensure their decks can be playable. Players then draft from that set card pool (called “the Cube”) instead of the usual sealed product; so rather than getting the obscure aliens from Jabba’s Palace or unusable interrupts from A New Hope that sealed drafts typically offer, players are drafting from a card pool that contains Darth Maul, Mara Jade, and other usable cards to create a more balanced and enjoyable experience.

### Presently, the Cube features the following: 

  * Total draft cards: 390 per side. 
  * Total fixed cards: 10 per side, six copies of each, 60 total 

  * Full cube total cards: 450 per side. 

**Note**: the Official Watto’s Chance Cube features standard virtual cards (no legacy virtual cards).

The complete rules, including the drafting procedure and tournament guide, can be found in the Watto’s Chance Cube Official Tournament Guide, which can be downloaded below.
