The Virtual Cards are split into 8 “blocks.” Each block covers a different theme.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 1: A New Hope[/title]

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 2: The Empire Strikes Back[/title]

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 3: Return of the Jedi[/title]

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 4: The Expanded Universe[/title]  
This block covers material from the expanded Star Wars universe, including the novels Shadows of the Empire, Jedi Search, and Heir to the Empire, the comic book Crimson Empire, and the video game The Force Unleashed.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 5: The Old Republic[/title]  
This block covers material from the three prequel films.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 6: Reflections IV[/title]  
In line with the theme of Decipher’s classic Reflections packs, you never know what you’re going to pull out of Block 6. A large block, it draws from all corners of the Star Wars universe and introduces a number of powerful new themes and cards into the game.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 7: Darkness Rising[/title]  
This block focuses on the epic military battles that made the Star Wars movies so visually thrilling. Whether it’s Rebel vs. Imperial or Republic vs. Separatist, there’s no shortage of action (or pilots) in Block 7.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Block 8: Scoundrels[/title]  
A wretched hive of scum and villainy, Block 8 showcases the fringe of the Star Wars universe. From Han Solo and Boba Fett to Kyle Katarn and… Lady Valarian? If you’d find them in a Cantina, you’ll find them here.
