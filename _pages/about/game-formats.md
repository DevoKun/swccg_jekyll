\[accordian\]\[toggle title=&#8221;Cube&#8221; open=&#8221;no&#8221;\]  
The Cube is a limited format for Star Wars CCG. It is a way to simulate a “sealed” format without having to actually open sealed product, which is becoming increasingly scarce. Additionally, it is far more interesting and balanced than the traditional Sealed Deck format. It consists of a [list of 480 cards](http://www.swccgpc.com/cube.xls) which players draft as well as 12 “unlimited” locations for each side of the Force. All of the cards in the Cube are playable on their own- there are no cards such as Luke’s Back or Darth Vader’s Lightsaber that require another specific card to be in your deck to function.

## How do you use it?

The Cube is meant to be a draft format. Each cube can support up to 10 players, so if you will have more than 10, plan accordingly and be sure you have enough cubes on hand. Be sure that you and your players read and understand the [Rules Cards](http://starwarsccg.org/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=getit&lid=107) before you get started, as there are special rules for the Cube that apply only to this format.

The players are divided into two “pods” with each pod playing either light or dark. (See the chart below to determine how many people you should have per pod.) Shuffle the cards for each side and create “packs” of cards to draft from 5, 9 card packs for each player. Players should not look at these packs until they are drafted from.

Each player picks up one pack, picks one card from the pack, and passes the rest of the pack to the player to his left. Repeat this until all nine cards from the first pack have been drafted, then pick up another pack, passing the pack to the right this time. Alternate passing the packs left and right until all of the cards have been drafted.

After each player has 45 cards (5 packs x 9 cards in each), pass out one set of the 12 unlimited locations to each player. Give the players about 20 minutes to make a 40-card deck, then pair and play like a normal sealed tournament. Unused cards (both drafted and unlimited locations) can be substituted in and out of decks between games.

## Number of Players per pod

You will need an even number in order to draft properly, so as the tournament director it is up to you to make an even number, whether that means playing or sitting out.

6 players- 1 cube, 3 per pod  
8 players- 1 cube, 4 per pod  
10 players- 1 cube, 5 per pod

For more players, simply multiply this out- for example, 14 players would be 2 cubes, with one cube having 3 per pod and the other having 4 per pod.

## How do you build it?

When sleeved, the cube fits perfectly into an Anthology box, so find a spare one of those to store it in. Gather all of the cards on the list above, including 5 of each of the unlimited locations (see the second tab of the Excel document for this list). The rules document (linked above) also includes all of the v-slips that are included in the Cube, so you don&#8217;t have to hunt them down set by set. If you don’t own all of the cards yourself, head on up to [the trade forum](http://www.swccgpc.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=359) and put up a list. Chances are, other people are trying to build cubes too, and you can help each other out. Also, [Category1Games.com](http://category1games.com/), has a large selection of “played” condition cards, which are perfect for this format, since you will likely never want to take cards in and out of the cube except when the official list is changed (usually quarterly).

You will need about 550 sleeves for your cube. I recommend buying 600- this will allow you to have spare sleeves on hand when they inevitably split. If your play group plans on using the Squirrel format, buy all sleeves of the same color, otherwise get two colors so LS and DS can be easily distinguished. If you search online, you can find good deals on boxes of sleeves. For example, [Potomac Distribution](http://www.potomacdist.com/) sells a box of 15 packs of one color sleeve for about $25. This is 750 sleeves, and much cheaper than buying packs of sleeves individually.

## Tips and Tricks for running a Cube event

  * Put colored dot stickers (found in the office supply section of most stores) on the unlimited locations, using a different color for light and dark. This makes them easier to sort out from the “draftable” locations.
  * Provide each player with a small box (OTSD box tops or bottoms work very well for this) to place his or her drafted cards in, so the pile of drafted cards does not get mixed up with undrafted packs.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Alternate formats for the Cube[/title]

  * **Odd number**: Use the [Winston Draft format](http://www.swccgpc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20361) suggested by PapaLorax.
  * **Smaller tournament**: If you only have four players, have the players draft decks for BOTH sides and play a traditional Swiss tournament.
  * **Squirrel format**: Run the same as the normal cube, except that you shuffle all 480 cards together, and players draft in one big pod rather than two pods by side. Locations can be placed either way at the discretion of the player who placed the location. Cards that reference “Rebel” or “Imperial” are played as-is, so watch out!
  * **Cube sealed**: Each player grabs 45 random cards from one side of the Force, then receive the unlimited locations and build a 40-card deck out of what they received.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Swiss w/ Strength of Schedule[/title]  
As many of you know, for the 2010-11 Tournament Season we will be using Strength of Schedule as the preferred tiebreaker. There have been many questions as to how this will work, and hopefully I will be able to answer most of them in this announcement. If not, feel free to ask.

**A preface:** We looked at a variety of different ways of calculating Strength of Schedule, all of which had their merits. Some are easier to use, but less accurate. Some are extremely accurate, but literally require a computer to calculate. We believe that the calculation method we chose has the best of both worlds- accurate, but not impossible to use on the fly. There are a couple of tweaks that we can make to the system if we feel that it is not working as intended, but we do not think these will be necessary.

**The calculation method is as follows:**

  * For all of your opponents: Calculate their total victory points, then calculate the total number of games they played. Divide the total VP by the total number of games played; this is your Strength of Schedule score.
  * If a player has fewer than .5 victory points per game played, adjust that players victory point total so it is equal to .5 VP/GP
  * Timed Wins are counted as Full Wins for Victory Points
  * In the case of two or more players having equal Strength of Schedules, drop each player’s lowest opponent until the tie is resolved.

Note: A bye does not count as an opponent for you (I.E. it has no effect on your SoS), but contributes both VPs and Games Played to an opponent.

## Questions

**Why are we changing to Strength of Schedule?**  
We see several advantages in using SoS rather than Differential:  
First, We feel that it more accurately reflects the performance of players in a given tournament. Rather than having huge differential scores (potentially due to playing against weaker players), this system allows those who have played against the tougher opponents on that day to be rewarded.  
Secondly, we believe that it will encourage players to play decks that, while good, may have had low differential when they won.  
Finally, it will prevent negative experiences from people trying to maximize their differential against a newer or weaker player.

**For what size events is Strength of Schedule required/recommended?**  
We believe that Strength of Schedule will work for any swiss event with a minimum of 8 players. However, at the current time it is only being required for events at which at least two byes are awarded. All other tournaments may use whatever tiebreaker method the Tournament Director prefers (though it must be announced ahead of time).

**Is this a system based on total Victory Points or Win Percentage?**  
This is a Win Percentage system.

**In many SoS systems, the lowest SoS score is automatically dropped, will that occur in this system?**  
No, the lowest SoS score is not dropped unless a tie in SoS occurs. We chose to use the minimum score adjustment method instead.

**How are drops handled by this system?**  
The Win Percentage method is not affected by drops for all practical purposes.

**What alternate methods did you look into, and why were they not ultimately chosen?**  
We looked at the method of using Total Victory Points rather than Win Percentage, but we found that it had serious problems accounting for both byes and players who dropped. We also looked at the system used for Magic: The Gathering, but found that it required a computer to be calculated quickly, and was thus unwieldy for our requirements.

**Why are Timed Wins counted as Full Wins in this system?**  
Under this system, it is always to your advantage for your opponent to have as many Victory Points as possible, in order to improve your Strength of Schedule score. Thus, the only scenarios in which a Timed Win would be given out would be 1. If you were trying to actively hurt your opponent’s chances by denying full VPs, or 2. If it benefited a teammate or friend to grant your opponent only 1 VP. We decided that it would be better if such an option was not allowed.

**Are there any specific rules related to Strength of Schedule that have not been mentioned yet?**  
Yes: Players may now openly decide the result of a match, and may concede at any time to their opponent. Note that a ‘tie’ is still not an option as the result of a match.

**Does Strength of Schedule affect pairings mid-tournament?**  
Yes, it makes them quicker, because nothing must be calculated between games- players are paired by Victory Points only. Strength of Schedule is only calculated in order to break a meaningful tie, such as a cut, or in certain cases a final victor. Additionally, this allows for easier calculation when players quit or are disqualified, because it does not affect the tiebreakers of their opponents so drastically. (See, for instance, a FW +30 for a major penalty)

**What do you hope to accomplish with the transition to Strength of Schedule?**  
We hope to foster an improved tournament environment. We hope that the environment will become more open and fair due to the elimination of factors such as differential manipulation at large events.
