[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Premiere[/title]  
(1995) &#8211; This was the first set for the Star Wars CCG and included the characters of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, C-3PO, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Vader as well as many other very useful cards that formed the core of the game. Perhaps the most potent strategies was to pair Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin at an important location. Acting in concert, they can cancel an opponent&#8217;s destiny draw (unless Vader is targeted by Uncontrollable Fury, which was released in the Cloud City expansion). All of the images from this set were taken from A New Hope. This set, along with A New Hope and Hoth, were sold in packs of 15 cards that retailed for US$3.00.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]A New Hope[/title]  
(1996) &#8211; This set featured additional cards taken from the first Star Wars movie. Important debuts in this set included Chewbacca and R2-D2. Also of note were the introduction of the Death Star as a system card, the introduction of creatures, and a new mechanic that allowed for the destruction of entire planets.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hoth[/title]  
(1996) &#8211; This was the first set to include images from The Empire Strikes Back. It was also the first set to introduce the mechanic of a &#8220;persona,&#8221; a version of a main character with alternate abilities (e.g., Commander Luke Skywalker vs. Luke Skywalker). Also included in this set were the immense AT-AT walkers. Another new rule was the &#8220;Hoth Energy Shield Rules&#8221; which prevents the Dark Side player from deploying his cards on the first four &#8220;marker&#8221; Hoth sites, and all interior Hoth sites; unless the Main Power Generators is &#8220;blown away&#8221;.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Dagobah[/title]  
(Wed April 23, 1997) &#8211; This set featured cards from the middle part of The Empire Strikes Back. Significant cards included Yoda, another new version of Luke (Son of Skywalker) and all of the bounty hunters, their ships, and weapons (except Boba Fett). This set was also the first to be sold in packs of 9 cards with an original retail price of US$2.50 per pack, where the last card in the pack would always be the rare. This was to ensure that players and collectors could acquire more rares and fewer commons and uncommons. When originally released, this set developed a bad reputation among players because of the introduction of many new strategies that focused the game on deck manipulation at the expense of the intense battling that had originally made the game so popular.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Cloud City[/title]  
(1997) &#8211; This set included new versions of Han and Leia and also introduced Lando Calrissian as a character card in the game. He was also unique in that he had both Light Side and Dark Side personas. It also finally added Boba Fett to the game (although he had been available as a preview card in the First Anthology released earlier in the year.) This set also introduced &#8220;dueling&#8221; as a major strategic mechanic for the Dark Side and provided for the possibility that Luke could be turned to the Dark Side. Cloud City also attempted to correct the abusive &#8220;numbers&#8221; strategies prevalent since the release of Dagobah. Due to a large print run, this set, as of 2009, is still very easy to acquire.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Jabba&#8217;s Palace[/title]  
(1998) &#8211; This was the first set to feature cards from _Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi_ and focused on the opening scenes of the film where the heroes tried to rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt. Jabba himself was an important card, as was the new version of R2-D2 (Artoo), but on the whole this set was seen as being fairly weak, especially from a tournament perspective, by players who complained that there were simply too many aliens that had little or no competitive use. This is, as of 2009, the cheapest and easiest set to purchase.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Special Edition[/title]  
(1998) &#8211; This was the largest set since Premiere and the first to introduce new starter decks (which included many cards that could only be found in them). This set was seen as something of an overhaul of the game since it changed some game terms and attempted to make the entire play experience more streamlined through the release of a comprehensive rulebook and glossary. The most notable addition in this set was the introduction of the &#8220;objective&#8221; mechanic. These cards allowed a player to start many more cards and provided a movie-based goal for a player&#8217;s deck. Many players praised this addition, arguing that it made little-used strategies (like freezing people in carbonite) useful. Others argued that it limited creativity and led to cookie-cutter decks based around various objectives that all looked and played the same. This set introduced the widely popular &#8220;Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith&#8221; persona.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Endor[/title]  
(1999) &#8211; This was the first of two sets to focus on the latter two-thirds of _Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi_. It included a vast number of characters and vehicles that were designed to be useful in battles. Upon release, this set garnered a poor reputation because of the sheer number of ostensibly new but seemingly redundant characters and vehicles contained therein. However, its reputation has improved since then, as later expansions have allowed for new decks featuring large amounts of Endor cards, and it is, as of 2009, one of the more valuable and expensive sets to purchase.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Death Star II[/title]  
(2000) &#8211; This set was the second to focus on the end of Return of the Jedi and along with Endor forms a stand-alone environment, in which all of the cards from those two expansions can be played independently of the other sets. This was also the first set to feature ultra-rare cards (Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Emperor Palpatine). The inclusion of these two very powerful and iconic characters, in addition to many useful supplementary cards, coupled with general praise for its elegant design, has given the set lasting appeal and led to it being, as of 2009, one of the more expensive sets to purchase. This set, and all after it, were sold in 11-card packs for a retail price of US$3.29.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Tatooine[/title]  
(2001) &#8211; Tatooine was originally scheduled to be a set based on the Skywalker family; this idea, however, was abandoned when Decipher decided to allow for elements of the film The Phantom Menace, the first of the prequels, to mix with the &#8220;Classic Trilogy&#8221; cards, at Lucasfilm&#8217;s request. Thus, this set includes Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul, Padmé Naberrie, as well as a younger version of Obi-Wan, and was heavily focused on &#8220;pod racing.&#8221;Anakin Skywalker was not included either in this set or the following ones to avoid problems with having both him and Darth Vader in the game (ultimately, no Anakin card was ever printed). This set, which contained fewer total cards than previous expansions, seems to have had a relatively large print run, and thus it is relatively easy and inexpensive to acquire.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Coruscant[/title]  
(2001) &#8211; Coruscant focuses on events from the middle of The Phantom Menace, especially Senatorial conflict. A very limited print run along with powerful strategies has made it by far the most expensive set and hardest to acquire. There are a number of notable cards in this set, including new versions of Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul as well as the introduction of Mace Windu.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8221;]Theed Palace[/title]  
(2001) &#8211; This was the last set produced for Star Wars CCG. The most popular and notable card in this set is Darth Sidious who was, at that time, not considered by Decipher to be the same person as Emperor Palpatine or Senator Palpatine in the &#8220;game universe.&#8221; For gameplay reasons, these three cards have still not been combined into one persona. This set is also somewhat difficult to acquire.
