# Light Side

\[accordian\]\[toggle title=&#8221;General Light Side Primer&#8221; open=&#8221;no&#8221;\]This is meant to be a general primer for what most LS decks are, how they tend to play, what they tend to be good against, and what the best way is to play against them. If a mod thinks it worthwhile, it would be nice to be stickied for new/returning players to get a general run down of what is out there. Also, any PMs with any deck-types would be nice to make sure that I haven&#8217;t missed anything. I plan to edit this to add decktypes as they come up and to finish up any ones I&#8217;ve missed.

## Space Packages

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Big Blue[/title]  
Home One with Captain Verrack v, Admiral Ackbar v (or non-v possibly), Major Haash&#8217;n and/or First Officer Thaanespi, Tantive IV v, Bright Hope v, Obiwan in Radiant VII, possibly Alderaan Consular Ship with Senator Leia. Indicators: TRM, Sonn v, Senate. Play notes: Control & Set for Stun is huge in these matchups as you can isolate cards or ships without Verrack v. Program Trap can be clutch to negate gametext against Tantive IV or Bright Hope v. Imperial Justice v can negate Ackbar, Verrack or negating Bright Hope v; however, one still must find a way to overpower them because it is likely difficult cracking Home One&#8217;s immunity although Astromech Shortage v can help with that. The expected ground package generally includes EPPs and other hit and runs; sometimes Sonn v decks use jedi with sabers or other motley collections. General expectation: space strong, ground weak. Platforms: TRM, Sonn v, Senate.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Matching Ships[/title]  
Luke Skywalker v in Artoo in Red 5 (or rarely in Red 5 v with R2D2), Han Solo Courageous Smuggler or Captain Han in Millennium Falcon (sometimes with Chewie v), Chewbacca v, Dash Rendar in Outrider (sometimes v in specific decks), Boshek Brash Smuggler in Boshek&#8217;s Modified Light Freighter, Wedge Antilles Red Squadron Leader in Red Squadron 1, Corran Horn in Red Squadron 7, Jek Porkins v in Red 6, possibly Obiwan in Radiant 7. Indicators: Squadron Assignments. Play notes: this can be the toughest space to beat as it generally is immune to

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Token[/title]  
Han Chewie in the Falcon (Reflections 3 non-v or v), Gold Leader in Gold 1 v, Obiwan in Radiant 7, Bravo Fighter v, Alderaan Consular Ship v with Senator Leia Organa v, Wedge in Red Squadron 1 v, Booster in Pulsar Skate v, Medium Transport v. Indicators: TRM, Senate, We Have a Plan. Play notes: Always remember to save force to draw battle destiny just in case Gold Leader in Gold 1 shows up. Remember to factor in the +2 force to initiate battle at Alderaan Consular Ship&#8217;s location. Decent to solid space packages should defeat this reasonably easy. Control & Set for Stun can be huge at times to remove Senator Leia to remove the Consular Ship&#8217;s immunity. There is no clear expected ground package&#8211;it really depends on the objective; however, often token packages may be part of a mains and toys build as a means to be able to hold presence at a system for Battle Order. Expect the usual ground tricks: Blaster Deflection, Obiwan&#8217;s Journal, Clash of Sabers, Sorry About the Mess & Blaster Proficiency, etc. General expectation: ground strong, Space weak. Platforms: Senate, Rebel Senate, TRM, WHAP, WHAPv, WYSv.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Republic[/title]  
Plo Koon v in Jedi Starfighter v, Obiwan Jedi Knight v in Jedi Starfighter or Obiwan in Radiant 7, Alderaan Consular Ship with Senator Leia Organa v, Republic Corvette, Clone Pilot v. Indicators: any deck with non-Rebel deployment restrictions.

# Light Side Decks

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]You Can Either Profit By This&#8230; / Or Be Destroyed [/title]  
A classic mains and toys deck. The first choice in this deck is often whether or not to start aliens to give your opponent a force that can be beaten down. Luke Skywalker Strong in the Force gives profit an extremely cheap main that is capable of becoming &#8216;fully loaded&#8217; with Luke&#8217;s Bionic Hand, I&#8217;m With You Too v, Obiwan&#8217;s Journal and Lightsaber Proficiency. Over committing to their locations may leave yours vulnerable to infiltration while they lock your drains down with undercover spies. Lando with Vibroaxe is a card to watch out against as he can instantly change fair battle into a one-sided affair. Beware of the Nabrum Leids beatdown and Run Luke Run. Imperial Justice can help prevent your battle destiny from being cancelled so you can clear their site. Spread in space safely knowing that there&#8217;s likely no opposition there. Versions can play Don&#8217;t Forget the Droids v, A Gift, multiple undercover spies, Trooper Sabaac, as additional means of gaining an advantage. The deck tries to flip and then spread safely to be draining for 2-3 at sites while dealing 2-3 direct damage from the objective. Other versions may try to setup a Jedi Presence beatdown. Texas Mini Worlds 2010 day 2: Joe Olson, Bill Kafer, MPC 2011 Matt Sokol, Mike Kessling

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Watch Your Step / This Place Can Be A Little Rough[/title]  
Mostly a space oriented deck designed on using Luke Skywalker v to continue to fetch out the matching pilots space fleet and then retrieve once a fleet is in place. Don&#8217;t be confused though, this deck is likely the best balanced platform deck ever as it is capable of delivering a beatdown in either platform as well as maintaining a solid presence in space or on the ground. This deck often plays a ground package of Palace Raiders in Crafts. Holding the Cantina and while shooting down Patrol Crafts with P59, Dengar with Blaster Rifle and/or P13 & P14 is often the key to beating WYS. Keep the pressure on as much as possible and you might be able to outlast them. On the Edge and Kessel Run are possibilities that can change the course of the game drastically. Often, decks like Hunt Down can deliver a large amount of damage initially that they can put enough pressure on the opponent to make the decision making process harder for it. This deck can have any number of tricks from Cantina Brawl, Run Luke Run, It Could Be Worse, etc. With the ability to play interrupts from the lost pile, the deck is often in the 65-75 card range effectively. Mathcups: this deck classically has a bad matchup against both mystril and HD. Texas Mini Worlds 2011 Kevin Shannon, Aaron Nelson

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Watch Your Step / This Place Can Be A Little Rough (v)[/title]  
This deck is slightly deceptive in that it often runs a token space package but starts with General Solo v in the Millennium Falcon v. This allows them to Antilles Maneuver v to pull Chewie v turn to have immunity to

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Throne Room Mains[/title]  
The goal of this deck is often to play a counter-punch strategy with EPPs; although the SoCal version utilizes immunity mains to provide a large drain and more staying power. The LTWWv variant allows for a far larger amount of turn 0 activation which can provide a different amount of tempo to the deck. The mere fact that this deck gets to go first can give specific decks problems as they can invade key locations early and/or create a large inequity in activation via Goo Nee Tay, Revolution and possibly Wrong Turn. According to My Design and Ni Chuba Na v help against TRM as they help protect against the choke aspects that may happen (Revo/Goo) and provide extra force. Many TRM decks currently play Kiffex as their system and the 3/2 or 2/2 naboo site OR the Lower Corridor CC 2/1 site as locations to drain at mid to late game. As of late, TRM has veered away from hit and run tactics in space in favor of big blue. Decks that can maintain an immovable ground presence can often give TRM fits. Expect some Sense tricks to ruin days as well. MPC 2011 day 2 Kevin Shannon, Reid Smith

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hidden Base / Systems Will Slip Through Your Fingers (v)[/title]  
This is often an immunity mains deck to setup big drains; alternatively it can be a drop and drain type of deck that combines the bonus drains with Celebration. Mace, Luke SitF, Leia RP, Master Quigon v, Obiwan v, etc. comprise the immunity mains version. The T47 variant will start Insurrection v in order to pull numerous unique exterior locations in addition to the Rebel Cell sites to make it impossible for the opponent to cover most/any of the locations you deploy to. It often uses a token space package headed by Home One. Tatooine is the system of choice to set up Celebration. Worlds 2009: Kevin Shannon, MPC 2010 Brian Herold, MPC2011 Brian Herold, Mike Richards

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hoth CRv[/title]  
This deck uses A New Secret Base to start up Echo Base Operations for big drains in space. This sets up far faster than Hidden Base and has more drain potential, but doesn&#8217;t really have any drain limiting abilities. It intends to satisfy BPlorder often with Snowspeeder Garrison and/or Dash +backup. Worlds 2009 day 2: Scott Lingrell

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Plead My Case To The Senate / Sanity And Compassion[/title]  
This deck uses the Coruscant Political Effects to dominate the ground. It plays EPPs on the ground has hit and runs and alters battle destiny draws in their favor. Grab A Jedi&#8217;s Resilience and/or Might of the Republic ASAP. Starting Imperial Justice and/or Ability Ability Ability v over Ni Chuba Na; note AAAv helps slow them down slightly in the Senate while Imperial Justice can be fetched later with WMAOP. However, IJv is more important generally to make sure that they can&#8217;t modify your draws. The space fleet can be anything from Han & Chewie in the Falcon v (Reflections 3 v version) to Big blue. Build notes: See Rebel Senate above. Texas Mini Worlds 2011 Mark Vandriel

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Plead My Case To The Senate / Sanity And Compassion (Rebel)[/title]  
This deck tries to use Bail Organa v to retrieve and the new political effect to add to drains. This doesn&#8217;t play any of the Coruscant political effects; however, it can recur Lando Scoundrel multiple times to add battle destinies. This deck is likely to use big blue in space and try and drain at the 3/2 or 2/2 Naboo location with Jedi and sabers. If you can, knock them out of the senate as often and as safely as possible; AAAv helps slow them down slightly to make this possible. Build notes: Force Lightning and The Emperor v really help in this matchup especially with Astromech Shortage v and Young Fool to POOP Mon Mothma. Galen and/or Build-a-Bear Vader with Choke effect can give this deck problems by being able to clear 2-3 senators per battle. Texas Mini Worlds day 2: Brian Herold

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]We Have A Plan / They Will Be Lost And Confused[/title]  
This deck is much like profit except it has different tricks. It generally plays a token space fleet at best, usually only Alderaan Consular Ship with Senator Leia. It will likely use Scomp Link Access v to start Quick Draw v and We’ll Take the Long Way and to pull 2-1Bv to loop it’s characters to the used pile. Alternate versions may choose to start with 3 effects usually Wokling v to pull WTtLW, Quick Draw v and a third of choice. Make sure to grab Control&Tunnel Vision, I’ve Decided to Go Back v, Blaster Deflection and/or A Jedi&#8217;s Resilience as (matchup) appropriate in order to prevent them from being able to retrieve them and loop them via WTtLW.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Light Saber Combat[/title]  
This is mostly out of vogue right now mainly because of the sheer amount of force it gives up and the defensive shield against it; however, Luke Skywalker Strong in the Force gives a large bonus to this deck. Although, Clinging to the Edge v allows the deck to deploy sabers from the lost pile. For mains decks, stacking two dark jedi at a site in one turn (while having a second copy of both ideal) forces them to come to you. Ability Ability Ability v also helps force them to either track around destinies that will likely force your dark jedi to go lost as your destinies should allow you to keep a decent force on Naboo. Elis Helrot can also provide a huge beat down provided it isn&#8217;t Sensed or cancelled otherwise. Blast Door Controls often can negate many of their defensive tricks.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Sonn v HDWGITM[/title]  
This has the same general choke package of SonnvLuke (Restricted Deployment, Goo Nee Tay, Stone Pile, etc.) but uses How Did We Get Into this Mess to cycle through the deck to deploy twixes and/or key locations or cards. The space fleet tends to be Big Blue; on the ground they usually use Jedi with matching sticks as it can easily cycle through the deck to find Quick Draw v and/or Sai&#8217;torr Kal Fas v. Grabbing HDWGITM with They&#8217;ll be Hell to Pay early in the first turn can generate major problems for this deck.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Sonn v 2/2[/title]  
This starts the Coruscant 2/2 site to play Yoda MoFo + saber turn 0 and start a quick set of drains. It starts Quick Draw v as its third effect and will play multiple Speak with the Jedi Council in order to get Yoda MoFo via the JCC (non-v) if necessary. The deck often plays Yoda, Luke SitF, Mace v, and either Master Quigon (v or non-v) or Obiwan Jedi Knight v. For space the deck uses x2 Artoo in Red 5 and x2-3 Han Chewie and the Falcon v. It will try to get down Tawss Khaa v early in order to prevent consistent drain cancellers (like Protocol Failure) from being able to prevent enough damage to keep the damage race close.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hidden Base / Systems Will Slip Through Your Fingers (Kingery)[/title]  
Aaron Kingery designed this amazing version to utilize Mon Cal starships (both unique and non-unique) in order to use Heavy Turbolaser Batteries and characters who add to weapon destiny draws in order to shoot everything out of the skies. This deck uses Barriers, Power Pivots, Hit and Runs, On Targets and Stay Sharps to avoid battles and/or negative battles. It tries to create a large amount of damage mitigation via ICBW, Merc Sunlet v, Projections, HB flip. It uses Naked 3po to setup Alter v on S&D or to help find cards that are needed and uses x2 3po pullers; because it puts him in space, he’s immune to Restraining Bolt and will always allow the opponent to upload a card with Protocol Failure. The endgame goal is to make shoot down all of the opponent’s ships, cancel all of their drains while flipped, prevent them from drawing up via the flip text and use Luke v to retrieve the whole lost pile for a big win (if differential matters). SoCal 2010 Johnny Chu.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Quiet Mining Colony / Independent Operation[/title]  
This deck tends to play a small mix of matching ships and immunity mains. Imperial Detention v can help force them to pay for cards like Kebyc v and Lobot v. Beware of Lando Scoundrel v with Lando&#8217;s Not a System He&#8217;s a Man to make someone&#8217;s forfeit 0 and help to crack immunity by adding to total BD. Cloud City Celebration and Flash of Insight v can provide a huge amount of retrieval. They can do numerous strange tricks with Path of Least Resistance to move one person from on Cloud City site to another Cloud City site (during battle or not): e.g. deploy someone, I Have a Bad Feeling About This to initiate battle, Run Luke Run and Path someone in while Sorry About the Mess combo to remove someone. This deck historically tends to play a large amount of evasion (Dodge, It&#8217;s a Trap, Path, etc.) to allow it to do various tricks and retrieve more via Cloud City Celebration. Choke Vader is often great in this matchup as he can choke the aliens and Lando that QMC plays. Texas Mini Worlds 2011 Bill Kafer

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]There Is Good In Him / I Can Save Him[/title]  
This deck often starts Luke Skywalker Rebel Scout v to retrieve and provide a choke factor via his text. Often it will play I&#8217;m With You Too v to increase dueling destinies so it can duel with Daughter of Skywalker with Courage of a Skywalker v and/or A Jedi&#8217;s Patience. In addition, I&#8217;m With You Too v is also used to cancel battle destinies so that you can win to stack a card. Some version may also intend to pull Obiwan in Radiant 7 via We Wish to Board at Once and place him out of play to use I Can&#8217;t Believe He&#8217;s Gone v to increase total power to help win battles as well as to increase activation. This deck I believe is supposed to have a good matchup against AOBS and Mystril since neither usually can drop an Imperial first turn to the Landing Platform and have a hard time dealing with a free starting Luke especially once powered up with Luke&#8217;s Bionic Hand, Obiwan&#8217;s Journal and/or I&#8217;m With You Too v. As always, Imperial Justice v helps negate the main problem with IWYTv and any sort of multiple destiny attack plan TIGIH has. Being able to remove Luke with The Emperor v and/or Force Lightning can help. This deck can have any number of various starts from Don&#8217;t Tread on Me v, The Signal v, The Signal, Podracing, HTFMF. Baroni Worlds 2011 Day 3

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Farming[/title]  
This is a more rogue deck that uses Harvest v start to put Hydroponics Station and Lars Vaporator as an alternate means to draw cards. Most versions start Shmi&#8217;s Hut to pull her to pull naked 3PO to start cycling possible with How Did We Get Into This Mess. Some versions use Owen Lars v and Beru Lars v to not allow opponents lightsabers and most EPPs from deploying to the farm; these versions tend to use Beru Stew v as an extra means to activate and generate cards via Beru Lars v and Lars Vaporator v. Against these decks grab Beru Stew v. Make sure to play Do They Have a Code Clearance to prevent your opponent from cycling Harvest to retrieve everything. Other versions just use Owen and Beru Lars combo. This deck may play Beggar&#8217;s Canyon, Luke v and Luke&#8217;s T16 for a choke effect and higher drains and/or Ardon Crell Vapor to increase drains; or it may just be a non-TRM platform for EPP beats. Keep on your toes. here

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Communing Mains[/title]  
SoCal designed this deck as a sort of TRM deck that utilizes Chewie Protector, Hero Luke, and EPPS in order to be able to go on the offensive against a wide variety of ground packages. For space it often runs the Big Blue home one type space package. For non-interactive matchups, it looks to setup constant drains at the Cantina while cycling pilots in space. Aaron Nelson/Kevin Shannon Worlds 2011 day 2

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Communing Speeders[/title]  
Reid and Harpster designed this deck. It uses communing to cycle rebels hiding in T47s. For non-interactive matchups it looks to setup Tatooine Celebration while maintaining constant plink drains. For interactive matchups, it looks to attack with Commander Luke v or other Rogues, hit something with the Dual Laser Cannon v and be able to force other forfeits. It has many tricks between Corellian Retort v, Yub Yub, Wedge RSL + Dash v, etc. For space it often runs the Home One Package. Reid Smith Worlds 2011 day 2[/toggle]

[toggle title=&#8221;Light Side Shield Tutorial&#8221; open=&#8221;no&#8221;]  
Ratings are opinions of Greedo&#8217;s Finger

1/4 stars: Non-meta, deck specific.  
2/4 stars: Deck specific somewhere in the meta.

&#8220;Plays on table. Whenever opponent excludes any character(s) from battle, they lose 2 Force. At end of opponent&#8217;s turn, if you control two battlegrounds (a site and a system) and opponent deployed a card with ability and did not initiate a battle, you may retrieve 1 Force.&#8221;

3 out of 4 stars. No one likes to be excluded, and a little retrievals nice.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Wise Advice[/title]  
&#8220;Plays on table. Your Immediate Effects may play for free. Whenever opponent cancels your card with Sense or Alter, place that canceled card in Used Pile.&#8221;

2 out of 4 stars. Good for manipulation decks. Otherwise just backup for Do, or Do Not.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Yavin Sentry[/title]  
&#8220;Plays on table. Colo Claw Fish is canceled. Opponent must first use X Force to deploy a non-unique card (except a Jawa or Tusken Raider) to a location, where X = the number of copies of that card at that location.&#8221;

2 out of 4 stars. More clone protection, or maybe Dreadnaughts.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Your Insight Serves You Well[/title]  
&#8220;Plays on table. Scanning Crew is canceled. If an &#8216;insert&#8217; card was just inserted or revealed, it is canceled. You lose no Force to Boonta Eva Podrace, and opponent&#8217;s retrieval from Boonta Eve Podrace may not be canceled. While you occupy three battlegrounds, Watto&#8217;s Box is suspended.&#8221;

3 out of 4 stars. More podrace protection with it&#8217;s original insert card text included. Better than Traffic Control.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Your Ship?[/title]  
&#8220;Plays on table. Cancels A Dangerous Time. Each player may play only one card with &#8220;sabacc&#8221; in title each turn. You may cancel an opponent&#8217;s card with &#8220;sabacc&#8221; in title by losing 1 Force from hand. 1 out of 4 stars.&#8221;

Who plays Sabacc? Some dude at Endor Regionals last year. Better pull your shield fast, cause you only get one chance. But still not common.

[toggle title=&#8221;General Dark Side Primer&#8221; open=&#8221;no&#8221;]This is meant to be a general primer for what most DS decks are, how they tend to play, what they tend to be good against, and what the best way is to play against them. If a mod thinks it worthwhile, it would be nice to be stickied for new/returning players to get a general run down of what is out there. Also, any PMs with any deck-types would be nice to make sure that I haven&#8217;t missed anything. I plan to edit this to add decktypes as they come up and to finish up any ones I&#8217;ve missed.

## Space Packages

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Big Blue[/title]  
Conquest v, Chimera, Other SD&#8217;s, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Admiral Chiraneau, etc. Indicators: Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (except for Imperial Occupaton/Imperal Control). Starting Evacuation Control v can help in limiting battle destinies in space. The general ground package in big blue is Blizzard 2 and General Veers v or other * walkers and Commander Igar; note, General Veers v will ALWAYS draw 2 battle destinies if you use Evacuation Control v or not (so don&#8217;t use ECv against Veers and only in space). Play notes: generally, you&#8217;ll want to grab Imperial Command against this deck; however in some cases, grabbing Trample may be more important. As well, watch out for Set for Stun ruining your space fleet. Conquest v essentially negates All Wings Report In combo so either force them to use Conquest v to cancel a different interrupt or use it prior or post battle. General expectation: Space strong, Ground Weak. Platforms: EOPS starting Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, EOPS starting Operational as Planned, ISB, Watto.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Little Blue[/title]  
Grand Admiral Thrawn v, Katana, Dreadnaugh Heavy Cruiser, Reserve Pilot v. Indicators: Fleet Security Protocols or Imperial War Machine. The expected ground package is non-unique AT-ATs with Veers v or General Veers v and AT-AT deployment Platforms. Play notes: Reserve Pilot v affects Total Battle Destiny so Evacuation Control is worthless against it; as well, it may be important to pull The Professor to prevent Reserve Pilot v from dropping down for free. As in big blue, it is likely most important to grab Imperial Command; however, deck dependant it may be more important to grab trample as they can generally pull Blizzard 2 v with the Ice Plains v as they will likely play x2 Trample. Try to save Corran Horn (and/or IL-19 and an ability guy) to deploy to an AT-AT deployment platform (if the opponent only has 1 on an AT-AT) to remove immunity to attrition then battle at the site. Realize that Grand Admiral Thrawn can allow the opponent, especially with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet v, to deploy multiple Dreadnaughts in a turn to try and overpower you. Some versions of this deck use Inconsequential Losses v and Laser Cannon Batteries so they can forfeit weapons to the used pile for forfeit =3 to help deal with attrition and to help to remove opposing ships. If they play IO/IC and pull Blizzard 4 v, makes sure to pull The Professor to prevent Mara from deploying for free the first turn. General expectation: balanced space and ground however extremely card intensive&#8211;so racing this deck is likely the way to play. Platforms: Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control, Hoth Combat Readiness v.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Matching Bounty Hunter Ships[/title]  
Bossk v in Hounds Tooth v, Zuckuss v in Mist Hunter v, Dengar v in Punishing One v or Dengar in Punishing One, Guri v in Stinger v, Ponda Boba v and possibly Darth Vader v in Vader&#8217;s Personal Shuttle, Boba Fett (cloud city) in Slave 1 v, Outer Rim Scout and/or Darth Maul or Darth Maul with Lightsaber in Maul&#8217;s Sith Infiltrator. Indicators: Combat Response, Lone Pilot (pulling either Bossk in Hounds Tooth or Guri v in Stinger v. Starting Evacuation Control v can be helpful if you play smugglers to negate Bossk v. There is not clear expected ground package; it could be as little as Darth Vader with Lightsaber, Mara Jade with Lightsaber and Darth Maul with Lightsaber or it could be General Veers v in Blizzard 2 and/or Command Igar in an AT-AT. Some decks like Bahr v may just play no ground and only use Dark Waters, Image of the Dark Lord v and/or U3PO to reduce drains. Play notes: Using All Wings Report In combo to spin against Bossk if he&#8217;s with a smuggler; as well, Chewie v on the Falcon and/or Evacuation Control help against Zuckuss v in Mist Hunter v and/or Darth Vader v from modifying your battle destinies. They may also use the Watch Your Back combo to substitute a battle destiny especially if Boba Fett (CC) in Slave 1 v is deployed. Some decks may use Black Sun Fleet to during the control phase so don&#8217;t allow a cheap beatdown because of this. General expecation: space strong, ground weak. Platforms: AOBS (non-Shada/Mystril), EOPS, Look Sir Droids v start with Combat Response, ISB starting Combat Response and CCT decks that start Special Delivery v.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Matching Ties[/title]  
General package&#8211;Black Leader in Galen’s Fighter or Black 1, Baron Soonter Fel in Saber 1 (possibly with cannons), DS612 in Black 2, DS613 in Black 3, Darth Vader v in Vader&#8217;s Personal Shuttle v, or Weapons Package&#8211; some of the above with Major Mianda in Scythe 1 (with weapon), Lieutenant Hebsly in Scythe 3 (with weapon). Indicators: General Package currently is Lone Pilot (pulling Black Leader and Black 1) or Weapons Package is Hunt Down v Starting Combat Response and You Cannot Hide Forever (see HDv Tacobill). The ground package for the general package can be General Veers v in Blizzard 2; the ground package for the weapons package is generally as little as Darth Vader with Lightsaber x3. There may be alternate ground packages dependant on the deck&#8211;especially with decks that. Play notes: Beware Tallon Roll (if Combat Response non-v) as Black 3 allows independent and republic ships to be roll targets. Evacuation Control v and/or Chewie v on the Millenium Falcon prevent Darth Vader v from modifying your destiny draws. Against the weapons version, beware Mianda relocating via Flagship Operations v firing and moving away via FLOPS. Grab All Power to Weapons, Dark Manuevers & Tallon Roll and/or Imperial Artillery (in the weapons version). This game may end as a damage race so play accordingly. General expecations: space strong, ground weak. Platforms: EOPS (starting Lone Pilot with Black Leader and Black 1), EOPS (Prepared Defense start), Hunt Down v (starting both Combat Response and You Cannon Hide Forever) and possibly any CCT deck that starts Special Delivery v.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Token[/title]  
Victory (or x2) with Grand Admiral Thrawn, Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, Dengar in Punishing One, Bossk in Hounds Tooth or Bossk in Hounds Tooth v, Boba Fett in Slave 1 or Boba Fett in Slave 1 v, Darth Maul or Darth Maul with Lightsaber in Maul&#8217;s Sith Infiltrator and possibly Trade Federation Support Ship. Indicators: AOBS, Mystril (AOBS with Shada start), Hunt Down, Coruscant Combat Response v, Hunt Down v starting Power of the Hutt and not Combat Response. The ground package varies in these decks but it tends to be mains and toys. For HD and Coruscant CRv, it&#8217;s mostly Choke Vader/Lord Vader, Arica v, Galen v and/or Darth Maul Young Apprentice with their sabers. In AOBS, it tends to be Bounty Hunters with built in weapons although rarely there will be some matching weapons. Mystril plays the random female characters there are. Play notes: expect the usual ground tricks in most of these decks&#8211;First Strike, You Are Beaten, Force Lightning, Sniper & Dark Strike, destiny adding, Set for Stun, Dr. Evazan, Disarmed, etc. Most will play some sort of counter for Rebel Barrier (often Blast Door Controls); most will play at least one copy of They&#8217;re Still Coming Through which redirects Fallen Portal in addition to cancelling Barrier. Klorslug v, Dark Approach v, Blaster Deflection, Corellian Retort v, Obiwan&#8217;s Journal and/or Houjix can help. General expecations: space weak, ground strong. Platforms: AOBS, AOBS (Mystril), Hunt Down, Coruscant CRv, Let Them Make the First Move and/or Hunt Down v.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Trade Federation[/title]  
Blockade Flagship v, Daultay Dofine v, Trade Federation Support Ship, Darth Maul, Maul&#8217;s Sith Infiltrator. Indicator: Invasion/In Complete Control. Play notes: You have to keep the Invasion side up or else you&#8217;ll likely lose. Tey How v makes the Blockade Flagship immune to <9; as well, one of the effects they start makes all your immunity to attrition -3. They can play the Trade Federation Support Ship as a &#8216;react&#8217; for 1 force so they can have reasonable power and forfeit value. Being able to cancel the ship deploying as a &#8216;react&#8217; helps. In addition, don&#8217;t blow yourself out versus Darth Maul in Maul&#8217;s Sith Infiltrator; you must make sure you have an answer for him. Generally, Invasion plays Destroyer Droids which will pretty much hit all of your characters all the time; so building up one site that will severely hurt them to attack may well be worthwhile. Beware Wounded Warrior and/or Set for Stun ruining your day. You&#8217;ll likely want to grab Droid Shutdown multiples from ruining your targeting so you can remove multiple droids in a battle. General expectation: ground very strong, space weak. Platform: Invasion.

# Dark Side Decks

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi / Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe[/title]A pretty classic standard deck. Usually a mix of Choke Vader, Darth Vader Betrayer of Jedi and/or Lord Vader. Some versions may use Build-a-Bear Vader for his overall effectiveness. Often a mix of Emperor Palpatine and The Emperor v; usually plays one Darth Sidious. Often plays Darth Maul Young Apprentice (or EPP Maul) and Galen. Often a token space package at best (generally Maul’s Sith Infiltrator x2 at most). Grabbing Force Lightning and/or Sniper (if they can retrieve the Sniper) usually helps; We Must Accelerate Our Plans is another reasonable option. Most versions use Conduct Your Search to deploy the Endor: Back Door and drain there possibly with Bane Malar v. Build Notes: Klorslug v is very good against Choke Vader, Sniper & Dark Strike and Dr. Evazan (or Dr. Evazan and Ponda Boba). Matchups: HDADTJ usually has a positive matchup against most ground decks (except WYSv) and a poor matchup against most Space decks. Often Undercover with spies and Out of Commission &Transmission Terminated cancel Visage giving you enough time to win especially with other retrieval. Reid Smith 2011 MPC, Dan Kim 2010 Worlds Day 3

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi / Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe (v) Mains[/title]This deck is pretty much just like regular Hunt Down except that the flip condition is slightly different. It will use Galen, a mix of Choke and Vader Betrayer, Cyborg Commander and a version of the Emperor. It&#8217;s your regular main&#8217;s platform except that it may play The Force Unleashed to be able to throw vehicles and/or choke scrubs. Expect the same tricks as regular Hunt Down otherwise. Note that it can pull Galen’s Fighter and attack with Black Leader + BFBH/Dengar w/gun v + One Beautiful Thing to make attrition = 0. Many versions start Endor Shield v and use ASP to pull Endor as a twix drain 2 system. Endor Shield versions often play Grand Admiral Thrawn and put him on the Victory for added help attacking WYS/WYSv in space. This deck likely plays a token space package at best. DDM created a strange and solid version utilizing Imperial Stockpile, Imperial Domination, Blaster Rifle v and plus power effects called Rambo Trooper. Texas Mini Worlds day 2: Bill Kafer and Greg Shaw, MPC 2010 Kevin Shannon, DDM at some European event

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]No Money, No Parts, No Deal! / You´re A Slave[/title]  
It tries to create a large amount of quick damage via Objective and drains. It often uses x2 barrier, x some Close Call v, x2-3 Ceasefire, etc. to try and protect Watto from weapons. Hear Me Baby Hold Together v and/or Sense can be huge to ‘break through’ and clear Watto. Characters who draw if unable to otherwise can also be huge as they will always get a BD at the junkyard. MPC2011 day 1 Aaron Nelson

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Invasion / In Complete Control[/title]  
There are two general builds of this deck: one with destroyer droids and one battle droids (often with tanks). In both cases, you&#8217;ll want to take over Naboo ASAP to keep them on the Invasion side so they don&#8217;t get two battle destinies in each and every battle. If they don&#8217;t start Where Are Those Droidekas? then starting Evacuation Control v will help limit Tanks ability to draw multiple battle destinies. If they use tanks, beware Open Fire! and/or Sniper to allow them to fire in the control phase. Destroyer droids tend to dominate any deck that is ground based. They can only use the Trade Federation space package. Build Notes: Leia&#8217;s Blaster Rifle and Quick Draw v can really help against some versions of this deck. MPC 2011 day 3 Kevin Shannon

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Carbon Chamber Testing / My Favorite Decoration (IG)[/title]  
Expect this deck to be a &#8216;good stuff&#8217; deck much like Senate with Lott Dodd as they will likely get to tunnel vision each turn with IG-88. If you can, building your deck with an ability 1 rebel can significantly help in this matchup as it often runs Aiii! Aaaa! Aggggggggg! x4. Removing IG-88 may be tough because he has reasonable immunity and can cancel a weapon destiny against him; if you knock him out, it&#8217;s more likely via attrition than battle destiny. Removing him often prevents Aiii! from ruining your day. Also, beware IG-88&#8217;s Neural Inhibitor wrecking your day. Mostly a set of EPPs, The Emperor v, Choke Vader etc. with the a token space package of Bounty Hunters in their ships for space (note: Conquest v and/or Trade Federation Support ship may also be played). Ground tends to be stronger than space but it is more of a balanced platform in general. Be careful of Hidden Weapons, Choke Vader, Boba Fett (SE) v and The Emperor v. Make sure to grab Aiii! Aaa! Aggggggggg! if you gave up an ability >1 rebel; next grab either Force Lightning, Imperial Artillery or Hidden weapons. Also, beware of a Sense wrecking your day. This is going to be the general war of attrition; so you have to make every battle count. Matchups: Against dedicated space decks this deck can have large problems; however, I believe it tends to have a positive matchup against WYS with specific builds. It usually tends to have a decent matchup against most ground decks. MPC 2010 day 3 Reid Smith

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Endor Operations / Imperial Outpost (Flips)[/title]  
Once this deck is flipped, it&#8217;s usually impossible to re-flip it. This deck is really one of the most open-ended decks build wise possible&#8211;it can use matching ties, matching bounty hunters, big blue etc. Heavy Space versions will usually use an ATAT and General Veers v to satisfy BPlorder; some versions use ATSTs with guns and walkers to use ESBv better and get a drain of 2 at the Back Door. Decks that go first can give EOPS a problem by controlling the Bunker initially so they can&#8217;t deploy Establish Secret Base v and to suspend Endor Shield v (so they can&#8217;t pull Admirals/General and your activation at Endor isn&#8217;t negated). However, unless you can get there before them, it&#8217;s not worth trying to force the issue though. You may have beat down potential early on with a spy and a weapon though if you can activate enough. Expect Big Blue if they start Dreaded Imperial Starfleet; otherwise expect either Matching Ties or Matching Bounty Hunters for space and possibly a &#8216;good stuff&#8217; mix of the two. Positive matchups vary depending on the build. Some versions will use According to My Design to start the Emperor at the DB for activation and to add some backup to satisfy BPlorder and/or Sense stuff; most builds will include it in the least for the TRM/Sonn v mathcups. Worlds 2009 day 3: Jonny Chu/Justin Desai, Texas Mini Worlds 2010: Aaron Nelson, MPC 2011 Matt Sokol

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]That Thing is Operational[/title]  
This is the EOPS deck uses Operational As Planned to start with Jerjerrod, DSII and an Effect in hand (often Imperial Arrest Order or combo). TTO is generally reasonably slow to setup. Expect a big blue space package and walkers on the ground. This deck can run as many as x5 Control (and/or combo version). Grabbing Control early can put a crimp on their usable force. Some versions use Commander Praji v and/or Come With Me v to cycle Lieutenant Grond v to cancel drains (in addition to Control); grabbing Imperial Command can be equally good dependant on what deck you&#8217;re playing. Build notes: Imperial Atrocity V can really help out against TTO damage as it often negates lots of damage until it is cancelled. Grimtaash can be huge to preemptively get rid of multiple Controls. For the most part this deck has been replaced by CPIv because both put up similar direct damage but CPIv has retrieval. Texas Mini Worlds day 2: Joe Olson

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Agents Of Black Sun / Vengeance Of The Dark Prince[/title]  
This is your general Bounty Hunters and capturing deck often. It will likely play a token space fleet mainly consisting of ZiMH x2 and EPP 4lom x1-2 but may play matching ships. Expect the usual bounty hunter shenanigans: Hidden Weapons, various forms of capturing, Scum and Villainy, etc. Some version may play Shada and plan to transform into Mystril. Beware many combat tricks: Barrier, Cease Fire, etc. to protect Xizor from weapons. Some versions may start Scum by using Twilek Advisor v, some may use Xizor v to pull Unexpected Interruption to pull Visored Vision v to pull Tatooine Jabba’s Palace to pull the AC to pull Jabba v to pull Scum (an added bonus of replacing Profit’s sites). Some versions may use According to My Design to start the Emperor to be able to force a good amount of quick damage with an easy flip. SoCal 2010 Johnny Chu Day 2

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Agents Of Black Sun / Vengeance Of The Dark Prince (Mystril)[/title]  
This is the version of AOBS that starts Shada and uses her text to add a battle destiny. As well, most Mystril get some pretty large bonuses to power and forfeit from No Bargain v. Note: some versions of this deck may actually start Xizor so they can deploy Palpatine then deploy Shada and No Bargain v to increase damage dealt. The goal is often two-fold: to out ping your opponent while retrieving with Draw Their Fire, Ability Ability Ability v, and Scum and Villainy and to overflow the opponent by stacking up a bunch of mystril to out power especially with multiple destinies. Evacuation Control v can give this deck problems; as well, various choke methods (Aim High, The Camp, etc.) can force the opponent to make choices. This deck often runs a token fleet of bounty hunters in their ships. Matchups: This deck is supposed to have a good matchup against WYS often a poor matchup against decks that played Revolution. As well, iirc TIGIH tends to be a bad matchup for this deck. Worlds 2009 day 2: Thomas Shumann

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Ralltiir Operations / In The Hands Of The Empire[/title]  
Post Revolution (the most recent redux not the card), between the lessening to Insignificant Rebellion v and the ROPS shield most former versions of this deck are dead. Previous versions played ATSTs to &#8216;react&#8217; so that they could spread in safety. A version with Aratech Corporation v and * biker scouts may be possible now with Raltiir: Supply Route v. The most current version I&#8217;ve seen uses ability 3 imperials (and some imperials who draw battle destiny while alone) to flip and uses Tarkin&#8217;s Orders v and Do they Have a Code Clearance to protect their characters and get a battle destiny. Controlling Raltiir early can give them problems flipping their objective. As well, the ROPS shield prevents your drains on Raltiir from being cancelled or modified and negates in addition to negating any deployment modifiers. Against the current version, grabbing Tarkin&#8217;s Orders v at the first chance can give them fits as they tend to not have a large amount of activation. Beware of random Sandwhirls making your characters go missing. Texas Mini Worlds 2011 Kevin Shannon, MPC 2011 day 2 Kevin Shannon, MPC2010 Reid Smith day 2

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Hoth CRv[/title]  
The goal if this deck is to setup a damage grind of drain 2 at the 3rd marker, ping 1 with YMSYL, ping 1 with the AO and drains at systems. It will solidify at the 3rd marker with General Veers v in a walker (often Blizzard 2 v to pull Trample and for armor 8). Most builds use a mix of Big Blue (Conquest v, Devastator v, etc) with some splashable space (BiHTv, BFiS1v, Vicotry) . These decks plan to satisfy attrition using Do They Have a Code Clearance v to make their ability 3 imperials forfeit 8/9. Grabbing Trample and/or Lightsaber Deficiency v can be a boon against these decks. Build Notes: Projection of a Skywalker and Menace Fades is huge to help negate some of the constant pings. Matchups: This deck has a strong matchup against Profit as well as a solid matchup up against most space decks (save possibly WYS). MPC 2011

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]My Lord, Is That Legal? / I Will Make It Legal[/title]  
This deck uses the Coruscant Political effects to alter destiny draws and Lott Dodd to tunnel vision each turn. This deck often uses a &#8216;good stuff&#8217; mix between matching ties and matching bounty hunter ships. The ground force is an EPP force lead by Darth Maul with Lightsaber with a possible mix of EPP Mara and EPP Dengar v. Build Notes: Civil Disorder v and Evacuation Control v can be huge to slow these decks down. Demotion v can also give this deck fits. Matchups: This deck generallyhas a very poor matchup against LS Senate especially rebel senate so most versions use x2 Emperor v and x2 The Point is Conceded to flip Mon Mothma to start frying people.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Bring Him Before Me / Take Your Father´s Place[/title]  
This deck&#8217;s goal often is more so to pull Palpatine and negate the use of Luke Skywalker than it is to actually duel to cross Luke over (though the latter can be possible. The best versions of this deck will likely be using Emperor’s Power to add a BD in each battle to try and clear via attrition. Activation can be a serious issue with this deck; starting LSDv for Mos Espa, NCNv and Establish Control v/Endor Shield v (for General Nevar) is likely the best option to negate that. Matchups: This deck tends to have a great matchup against Profit and Senate.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Set Your Course For Alderaan / The Ultimate Power In The Universe (Monkey Ties)[/title]  
More often than not, this deck starts Set Your Course For Alderaan and plans to not flip; some historical versions used Senate as a base however. It often uses Dreaded Imperial Starfleet and TIE Interceptors to negate drains while retrieving with Seinar Fleet Systems. It often will use SYCFA and place a TIE, Darth Sidious and/or Emperor Palpatine at the death star docking bay to satisfy Battle Plan while being practically immune to damage and removal (save weapons). The deck&#8217;s goal is to out damage the opponent while retrieving. Often, this deck can be frustrated by grabbing All Power to Weapons early, playing Aim High and occupying Wakeelmui to put a cramp on the deck&#8217;s force. Grabbing Ghhk to prevent multiple uses is also terribly useful. The deck will often spread with single ties at systems and either react with The Emperor&#8217;s Shield (retrieving 3); note, they must play All Power to Weapons prior to &#8216;reacting&#8217; so the shield will neither get the power bonus nor gain the immunity.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]FLOPS—See Monkey Ties[/title]  
This deck will start the Meditation chamber, IAO&SP, I’ll Take Them Myself and YCHF&MobPoints to pull Walkeelmui or Flagship Executor. It will pull Galactic Domination to setup Flagship Operations and do the general Monkey Ties tricks except that it can deploy the non-unique TIE Squadrons to retrieve 3 with Sienar Fleet Systems. TMW 2011 Black Huffman, DDM using a weird version at some European event.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Commence Primary Ignition (v)[/title]  
This deck is a SYCFA deck that plans to flip using CPIv and drain and do Tarkin’s Orders damage plus use CPIv to get some extra direct damage in. The recommended start always includes A Million Voices but many people dispute the best choice from there. Other starting effect choices include Inconsequential Losses v, Kuat Drive Yards v, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet v, Imperial Stockpile (for LCB) and Endor Shield v (to get Admiral Motti v to make the Death start move at Hyperspeed 2 and General Veers to occupy the DB in an ATAT). Most versions will use three low parsec systems to drain/direct damage at. Many versions use fully immune dark jedi (Emperor/Sidous) to occupy the DB for BPlorder sometimes with or without Heroic characters and/or EPP Maul. Other versions may use Fleet Security Protocols to make a non-unique walker fully immune with 1 or more of the 1/0 site. The deck uses Relentless Pursuit, Lateral Damage, Control & Set for Stun and They’ve Shutdown the Main Reactor to try and control space. A European variant uses Dreaded Imperial Starfleet to pull up Tie Squadrons to use All Power to Weapons to try and overpower the opponent in space.[/toggle]
