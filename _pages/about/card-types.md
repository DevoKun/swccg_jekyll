The cards in the game consist of many different card types. Each card type (with the exception of Locations) can be distinguished by an icon in the upper left hand corner of the card. Below is an outline of the basic card types:

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Locations[/title]  
Locations are where the action happens. Most locations represent either a place on the ground (a “site”) or the area in orbit around a planet (a “system”). Locations are where characters and ship will deploy, battle, and move. There is also a 3rd type of location, known as a “sector” but most basic decks will not includes sectors.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Characters[/title]  
Characters are fairly straightforward. These are the people who make up the core of the Star Wars universe, as well as the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Characters deploy from your hand to locations on the table and can move from place to place, interact, and battle with each other. Characters can only exist where there is atmosphere, hence they may only deploy to sites, or aboard starships at a system. A character cannot deploy directly to a system without the use of a starship (they would be floating in space).

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Starships[/title]  
Starships deploy to systems and allow characters to deploy aboard them.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Vehicles[/title]  
Vehicles are similar to starships but deploy mostly to sites instead of systems and are used on the ground.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Weapons[/title]  
A Weapon is a card that usually deploys on a character, vehicle, or starship and augments that card’s abilities in battle. It is entirely possible to have a battle without weapons, but weapons are a good way to allow your forces an extra advantage in battle.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Devices[/title]  
Devices are similar to weapons in that they deploy on other cards and augment those cards’ abilities, but instead of augmenting their abilities in battle, Devices generally augment a card’s abilities outside of battle.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Effects[/title]  
An Effect is a card that deploys on the table and causes some type of change in the game state which continues as long as the Effect remains on the table.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Interrupts[/title]  
Similar to an Effect, but with some key differences. While an Effect only deploys during its owner’s Deploy Phase, an Interrupt may be played at any time, on either players’ turn. However, the interrupt does not remain on the table. It merely resolves itself and is then placed in either its owner’s Used Pile or Lost Pile, depending on the type of Interrupt.

[title size=&#8221;2&#8243;]Objectives[/title]  
Objectives are powerful cards around which one can base an advanced deck. Decks can only include a maximum of 1 objective card and that objective starts the game on the table and will be the focus of your deck. Objectives are double sided cards. The front side of an objective will generally contain text allowing you to setup your deck in a particular way and proving you with a goal that you must achieve. Upon completion of this goal you will be allowed to “flip” your objective and the backside of the objective card will give you a number of bonuses as a reward for flipping your objective.
