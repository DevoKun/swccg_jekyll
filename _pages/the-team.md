## Current Advocates

Since the creation of the Players Committee, the Star Wars: CCG has been powered by dedicated volunteers from that loyal playing community. Leaders in charge of the various sections the Player’s Committee have come and gone as life has deemed necessary, and other members of the playing community have risen in their stead.

Originally [selected by Decipher](http://decipher.ruddog.com/starwars/playerscommittee1.html) during the game&#8217;s transition into the hands of Players Committee, the following players are currently serving the players as Advocates:

**[Advocate](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8), Lead Advocate**  
From his secret underground lair, Scott supervises the Players Committee as Lead Advocate. Some say that he is actually the brain of a former Decipher employee suspended in a jar of nutrients, wholly dedicated to keeping the card game alive. Others say that he&#8217;s a mild-mannered business professional by day, as unassuming in daily life as he is conspicuous online, as is evidenced by a myriad of daytime office selfies. We suspect that the truth is somewhere in the middle.

**[<b class="gen">quickdraw3457</b>](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=595), Design Advocate**  
Matt C. is the stalwart Design Advocate, a position that lets him utilize his innate imagination and creativity. He leads up the Design branches (including the Design Team and Player Card Development Team, as well as Development Team) in the creation of new and exciting cards. Prior to being named Design Advocate, Matt served as a very active volunteer, including a playtester and Design Intern.

**[imrahil327](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=1885), Tournament Advocate**  
An expat of Northern California, Chris S hails from sunny San Diego, a classy city befitting a classy guy. A Giant among Padres and Dodgers, Chris enjoys good food, nerd games, snuggling and long walks on the beach with a certain two-time former world champion. He will NOT get you passes into ComicCon.

**[Shadow 14](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=16), Marketing Advocate**  
Chris Menzel, otherwise known as the &#8220;Euro Emperor,&#8221; heads up the Marketing Department of our game. He is responsible for continuing to grow the game. Hailing from Germany, Chris is a former European Champion and over the course of his time as a PC Volunteer has run large scale events, maintained and grown entire game play communities, and remains an active player who always brightens the room with his friendly and welcoming personality.

**[darkjediknight11](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=1239), Communications Advocate**  
Many things can be said about Keith B, known as &#8216;Keef&#8217; to some, but none of them involve wasting time around the house. Keith is master homebrewer and an avid traveler, breaking up his trips to SWCCG events with vacations to Sweden, Brazil, Japan and all manner of other international destinations. Don&#8217;t be fooled by that crusty, apathetic exterior: Inside Keef beats a heart of gooey caramel nougat.

**[Aglets](http://www.starwarsccg.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=759), Rules Advocate**  
Tim S. is the rules guru of our game. An expert in the Advanced Rulebook, Tim can explain exactly how that Program Trap card words without blinking an eye. Having served multiple stints as Rules Advocate, Tim can usually be found in his black and orange jacket rooting for the Orioles.
